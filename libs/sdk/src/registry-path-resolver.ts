/**
 * Self-healing path resolver for the registry handshake/discovery rollout.
 *
 * PREPARATORY in Phase 0: this resolver is NOT yet wired into the transport or
 * discovery. Core still serves ONLY the legacy dotted routes
 * ({@link LEGACY_REGISTRY_PATHS}) and the SDK still calls them directly. The
 * resolver lands here so Phase 1/2 can flip on dual-serve + fallback without a
 * second logic change.
 *
 * Once that flip happens, two HTTP paths serve one logical registry operation
 * during the rolling-deploy window: the new slash form ({@link REGISTRY_PATHS})
 * and the legacy dotted form. A caller will try
 * {@link RegistryPathResolver.candidates} in order, call
 * {@link RegistryPathResolver.remember} on the first 200, and call
 * {@link RegistryPathResolver.invalidate} on a 404 against the cached path.
 *
 * The cache is a HINT, not a lock. `candidates()` keeps BOTH paths reachable
 * even after a winner is cached, so a 404 on the cached path falls through to
 * the other candidate within the SAME call — no failed heartbeat. `invalidate()`
 * then drops the hint so the next call re-resolves from scratch. This is what
 * makes the resolver survive a mid-rollout core rollback (a new-SDK pillar that
 * cached the new path meeting a core instance that no longer serves it): a naive
 * one-shot cache would 404 forever and the pillar would be evicted.

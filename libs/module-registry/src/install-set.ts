/**
 * Install-set resolver shared by the build script (`scripts/build.ts`) and
 * the runtime `INSTALLED_MODULES` export (PRD-218 US-01).
 *
 * Mirrors the PRD-100 `POPS_APPS` / `POPS_OVERLAYS` env contract:
 *
 *   - Both env vars unset  → install every known id.
 *   - At least one set     → install only the union of their CSV entries,
 *                            intersected with the known id list.
 *   - `alwaysInstalled` ids stay in the result regardless. `registry`
 *     (formerly `core`) is the canonical example — it is the platform shell
 *     and must never be gated.
 *
 * Unknown ids in the env vars are silently dropped here because
 * `apps/pops-api/src/modules/env-modules.ts` is the canonical strict
 * validator at boot. This resolver only needs to know the resulting id set.

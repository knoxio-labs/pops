# US-01: Movie and TV schema

> PRD: [028 — Media Data Model & API](README.md)
> Status: Partial

## Description

As a developer, I want the movies, tv_shows, seasons, and episodes tables with proper indexes and FK cascades so that media metadata can be stored with enforced TV hierarchy.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `movies` table created with all columns per the data model (id, tmdbId, imdbId, title, originalTitle, overview, tagline, releaseDate, runtime, status, originalLanguage, budget, revenue, posterPath, backdropPath, logoPath, posterOverridePath, voteAverage, voteCount, genres, createdAt, updatedAt)
- [x] `movies` indexes on: tmdbId (UNIQUE), title, releaseDate
- [x] `tv_shows` table created with all columns per the data model (id, tvdbId, name, originalName, overview, firstAirDate, lastAirDate, status, originalLanguage, numberOfSeasons, numberOfEpisodes, episodeRunTime, posterPath, backdropPath, logoPath, posterOverridePath, voteAverage, voteCount, genres, networks, createdAt, updatedAt)
- [ ] `tv_shows` indexes on: tvdbId (UNIQUE), name, firstAirDate — tvdbId and name indexes exist; `firstAirDate` index missing
- [x] `seasons` table created with FK to tv_shows(id) ON DELETE CASCADE (id, tvShowId, tvdbId, seasonNumber, name, overview, posterPath, airDate, episodeCount, createdAt)
- [ ] `seasons` indexes on: tvdbId (UNIQUE), (tvShowId + seasonNumber) UNIQUE composite, tvShowId — tvdbId UNIQUE and tvShowId exist; `(tvShowId + seasonNumber)` UNIQUE composite missing
- [x] `episodes` table created with FK to seasons(id) ON DELETE CASCADE (id, seasonId, tvdbId, episodeNumber, name, overview, airDate, stillPath, voteAverage, runtime, createdAt)
- [ ] `episodes` indexes on: tvdbId (UNIQUE), (seasonId + episodeNumber) UNIQUE composite, seasonId — tvdbId UNIQUE and seasonId exist; `(seasonId + episodeNumber)` UNIQUE composite missing
- [x] Deleting a tv_show cascades to all its seasons and episodes
- [x] Deleting a season cascades to all its episodes
- [x] `seasonNumber` 0 is allowed (specials)
- [ ] `genres` column defaults to '[]' and stores valid JSON arrays — no DEFAULT '[]' in schema; genres stored as nullable TEXT
- [x] Tests verify table creation, FK cascade behaviour, unique constraint enforcement, and index existence

## Notes

Per [ADR-008](../../../../architecture/adr-008-media-split-tables.md), movies and TV shows use separate tables rather than a unified media_items table. The TV hierarchy (show > season > episode) is enforced at the database level via foreign keys with CASCADE deletes. All PKs are auto-increment integers.

**Audit findings** (`apps/pops-api/src/db/schema.ts`): All 4 tables exist with correct columns and FK cascades. Missing: `firstAirDate` index on tv_shows; `(tvShowId + seasonNumber)` UNIQUE composite on seasons; `(seasonId + episodeNumber)` UNIQUE composite on episodes; `genres` has no DEFAULT '[]' (nullable TEXT).

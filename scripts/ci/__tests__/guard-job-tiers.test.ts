/**
 * The guard-job tier invariant (ADR-045, tier amendment).
 *
 * Guard jobs come in two tiers. A **Tier A** job runs its guards straight after
 * `actions/checkout` with no `pnpm install`, so the gate answers in seconds and
 * cannot be broken by a dependency problem it exists to be independent of. A
 * **Tier B** job installs the workspace first, because its guards read YAML or
 * TOML through a real parser.
 *
 * The split only holds while somebody can say which job is which. Nobody can,
 * by reading: the tier of a job is a property of the transitive import closure
 * of every script it runs, and one `import { load } from 'js-yaml'` three files
 * deep moves it. Left to review, the failure is a `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` inside a
 * REQUIRED check — not a red build on the PR that caused it, a red build on
 * every PR afterwards.
 *
 * So the tier is not declared anywhere. It is DERIVED, and by the only method
 * that cannot be fooled: every Tier A guard is loaded for real, in a copy of
 * `scripts/` with no `node_modules` anywhere above it. A static import scan
 * would have to model multi-line imports, dynamic imports, and the import
 * statements these guards embed inside self-test fixture strings; loading the
 * module asks Node the same question CI asks it.

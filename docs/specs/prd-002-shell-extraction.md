# PRD-002: Shell & App-Finance Extraction

**Epic:** [02 — Shell Extraction](../themes/foundation/epics/02-shell-extraction.md)
**Theme:** Foundation
**Status:** Approved
**ADRs:** [002 — Shell Architecture](../architecture/adr-002-shell-architecture.md)

## Problem Statement

All frontend code lives in `apps/pops-pwa/` — layout, providers, routing, pages, and domain components are interleaved in one package. To support multiple apps (media, inventory, fitness, etc.) on a shared shell, we need to split the platform infrastructure from the finance domain code.

## Goal

Create `apps/pops-shell/` as the single frontend entry point (layout, providers, routing, theming) and `packages/app-finance/` as the first app package (finance pages + domain components). After extraction, adding a new app means creating a new `packages/app-*` package and registering its routes in the shell.

## Requirements

### R1: Shell Package (`apps/pops-shell/`)

The shell owns everything that's shared across apps:

```
apps/pops-shell/
  package.json            (@pops/shell)
  tsconfig.json
  vite.config.ts          (migrated from pops-pwa, updated aliases)
  index.html              (migrated from pops-pwa)
  src/
    main.tsx              (entry point, mounts App)
    app/
      App.tsx             (providers: tRPC, React Query, theme, toaster, router)
      router.tsx          (lazy-loads app routes, wraps in RootLayout)
      layout/
        RootLayout.tsx    (top bar + sidebar + outlet + error boundary)
        TopBar.tsx        (POPS branding, theme toggle, user info)
        Sidebar.tsx       (app-level navigation — just Finance for now)
    lib/
      trpc.ts             (tRPC client config — unchanged)
    store/
      uiStore.ts          (sidebar state)
      themeStore.ts       (theme state)
      themeStore.test.ts
```

**Key changes from current pops-pwa:**
- `router.tsx` lazily imports route definitions from `@pops/app-finance` instead of statically importing page components
- Sidebar renders navigation items from the active app's route config (not a hardcoded list)
- Theme CSS imported from `@pops/ui/theme`
- All shared component imports come from `@pops/ui`

### R2: App-Finance Package (`packages/app-finance/`)

Finance becomes a workspace package that exports its route definitions:

```
packages/app-finance/
  package.json            (@pops/app-finance)
  tsconfig.json
  src/
    index.ts              (exports routes and nav config)
    routes.tsx            (route definitions with lazy-loaded pages)
    pages/
      DashboardPage.tsx
      TransactionsPage.tsx
      EntitiesPage.tsx
      BudgetsPage.tsx
      InventoryPage.tsx   (stays here for now — moves to app-inventory in Phase 2)
      WishlistPage.tsx
      ImportPage.tsx
      AiUsagePage.tsx
    components/
      imports/            (entire ImportWizard and sub-components)
      TagEditor.tsx
      TagEditor.stories.tsx
    store/
      importStore.ts
    lib/
      transaction-utils.ts
```

**Public API:**

```typescript
// packages/app-finance/src/index.ts
export { routes } from './routes'
export { navConfig } from './routes'
```

**Route definitions:**

```typescript
// packages/app-finance/src/routes.tsx
import { lazy } from 'react'

const DashboardPage = lazy(() => import('./pages/DashboardPage'))
const TransactionsPage = lazy(() => import('./pages/TransactionsPage'))
// ... etc

export const navConfig = {
  id: 'finance',
  label: 'Finance',
  icon: '💰',  // placeholder — proper icons in PRD-003
  basePath: '/finance',
  items: [
    { path: '', label: 'Dashboard', icon: '📊' },
    { path: '/transactions', label: 'Transactions', icon: '💳' },
    { path: '/entities', label: 'Entities', icon: '🏢' },
    { path: '/budgets', label: 'Budgets', icon: '💰' },
    { path: '/inventory', label: 'Inventory', icon: '📦' },
    { path: '/wishlist', label: 'Wish List', icon: '⭐' },
    { path: '/import', label: 'Import', icon: '📥' },
    { path: '/ai-usage', label: 'AI Usage', icon: '🤖' },
  ],
}

export const routes = [
  { index: true, element: <DashboardPage /> },
  { path: 'transactions', element: <TransactionsPage /> },
  { path: 'entities', element: <EntitiesPage /> },
  { path: 'budgets', element: <BudgetsPage /> },
  { path: 'inventory', element: <InventoryPage /> },
  { path: 'wishlist', element: <WishlistPage /> },
  { path: 'import', element: <ImportPage /> },
  { path: 'ai-usage', element: <AiUsagePage /> },
]
```

### R3: Routing Changes

**Current routes:**
```
/                → DashboardPage
/transactions    → TransactionsPage
/budgets         → BudgetsPage
...
```

**New routes:**
```
/                → Redirect to /finance
/finance         → DashboardPage (index)
/finance/transactions → TransactionsPage
/finance/budgets      → BudgetsPage
...
```

**Shell router structure:**

```typescript
// apps/pops-shell/src/app/router.tsx
import { createBrowserRouter, Navigate } from 'react-router'
import { RootLayout } from './layout/RootLayout'
import { NotFoundPage } from './pages/NotFoundPage'
import { routes as financeRoutes } from '@pops/app-finance'

export const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: '/',
    element: <RootLayout />,
    errorElement: <RootLayout><NotFoundPage /></RootLayout>,
    children: [
      { index: true, element: <Navigate to="/finance" replace /> },
      {
        path: 'finance',
        children: financeRoutes,
      },
      // Future: { path: 'media', children: mediaRoutes }
      { path: '*', element: <NotFoundPage /> },
    ],
  },
])
```

**Error handling:**
- A catch-all `*` route renders a `NotFoundPage` within the shell layout (nav stays visible so the user can navigate away).
- An `errorElement` on the root route catches React Router errors (e.g., lazy-load failures) and renders the same layout + error page instead of the React crash screen.
- `NotFoundPage` shows: "Page not found" heading, the invalid URL, and a link back to the home page. Minimal — no elaborate illustrations.

### R4: Shell Chrome Scroll Behaviour

The shell chrome (TopBar + sidebar navigation) must remain **fixed on screen** while page content scrolls. The user must always have access to navigation regardless of scroll position.

**TopBar:** Fixed to the top of the viewport. Use `fixed top-0 w-full z-40` (not `sticky`).

**Sidebar nav (AppRail + PageNav):** Fixed height, does not scroll with content. Use `fixed` or `sticky top-{topbar-height}` positioning with `h-[calc(100vh-{topbar-height})]` and `overflow-y-auto` for long nav lists.

**Content area:** Scrolls independently below the fixed TopBar, beside the fixed sidebar. The `<main>` element handles its own scroll.

**Critical implementation note:** `position: sticky` breaks when any ancestor element has `overflow: hidden`, `overflow: auto`, or `overflow: scroll`. The shell layout must not apply `overflow-hidden` to any ancestor of sticky/fixed chrome elements. If overflow containment is needed (e.g., for decorative background blurs), apply it to a separate element that is not an ancestor of the TopBar or sidebar.

### R5: Page-Level Navigation (Back Button + Breadcrumbs)

**Rule:** Pages fall into two categories based on how they're accessed:

| Category | Accessed via | Back button | Breadcrumb | Examples |
|----------|-------------|-------------|------------|---------|
| **Top-level** | Sidebar/PageNav link | No | No | Library, Watchlist, History, Rankings, Dashboard |
| **Drill-down** | Link from another page (detail, settings, form) | Yes | Yes | Movie detail, TV show detail, Season detail, Plex settings, Item detail, Item form |

#### Back button

**Drill-down pages must show a back button:**
- Position: top-left of the page header, before the breadcrumb and title.
- Icon: `ArrowLeft` from Lucide.
- Behaviour: navigates to the **logical parent** (not `history.back()`), so the destination is predictable regardless of how the user arrived.
- Style: ghost button or plain icon link, consistent across all apps. App packages may apply their own colour accent (e.g., inventory uses amber) but the pattern is the same.

#### Breadcrumbs

**Drill-down pages must show a breadcrumb trail** showing the user's position in the page hierarchy. Each segment is a clickable link except the current page (plain text).

**Breadcrumb structure by page:**

| Page | Breadcrumb |
|------|-----------|
| Movie detail | Library → *Movie Title* |
| TV show detail | Library → *Show Title* |
| Season detail | Library → *Show Title* → *Season N* |
| Plex settings | Settings → *Plex* |
| Item detail | Items → *Item Name* |
| Item form (create) | Items → *New Item* |
| Item form (edit) | Items → *Item Name* → *Edit* |
| Transaction detail | Transactions → *Entity Name* |

**Breadcrumb formatting:**
- Separator: `›` or `/` — consistent across the app.
- Clickable segments: `text-muted-foreground hover:text-foreground` link style.
- Current page (last segment): `text-foreground font-medium`, not clickable.
- Truncation: on mobile, collapse middle segments with `…` if the breadcrumb exceeds available width. Always show the first and last segments.

**Top-level pages show neither a back button nor a breadcrumb** — the sidebar/PageNav is the navigation mechanism.

#### Implementation

The `@pops/ui` library should provide a `Breadcrumb` component (already scaffolded in PRD-001 R1). All app PRDs that define drill-down pages must include the back button and breadcrumb in their page layout spec. The standard page header pattern is:

```tsx
<div className="flex items-center gap-3">
  <Link to={parentPath}>
    <ArrowLeft className="h-5 w-5" />
  </Link>
  <Breadcrumb items={[
    { label: "Library", href: "/media" },
    { label: movie.title },
  ]} />
</div>
```

**Never place back navigation at the bottom of the page** — it's invisible until the user scrolls past all content, which is terrible UX on long detail pages.

### R6: Sidebar Navigation

The Sidebar reads navigation config from registered apps instead of a hardcoded list. For now it only shows Finance, but the data structure supports multiple apps.

```typescript
// Shell knows about registered apps
const registeredApps = [
  { ...financeNavConfig },
  // Future: { ...mediaNavConfig }
]
```

The Sidebar renders:
- App name/icon for each registered app (clickable, navigates to app's basePath)
- Page links for the currently active app

This is a minimal version — the full app switcher UX is PRD-003.

### R7: Provider Stack

The provider stack moves from `pops-pwa/App.tsx` to `pops-shell/App.tsx`. No changes to the providers themselves:

```typescript
<trpc.Provider client={trpcClient} queryClient={queryClient}>
  <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
    <ReactQueryDevtools />
    <Toaster />
  </QueryClientProvider>
</trpc.Provider>
```

The tRPC client config (`lib/trpc.ts`) moves to the shell unchanged. The `AppRouter` type import stays as `@pops/api` until Epic 3 (API modularisation) renames it.

### R8: Vite Config

The shell's Vite config is based on the current `pops-pwa/vite.config.ts`:

- Same plugins: `react()`, `tailwindcss()`
- Proxy `/trpc` → `localhost:3000` (unchanged)
- Dev server port: 5566 (unchanged)
- Resolve alias: `@` → `apps/pops-shell/src`
- Workspace packages resolved natively by Vite (no special config needed for `@pops/ui`, `@pops/app-finance`)
- Storybook Vitest plugin config needs updating — story discovery from `packages/` directories

### R9: E2E Test Migration

4 Playwright spec files need route updates:

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `transactions.spec.ts` | `/transactions` → `/finance/transactions` |
| `transactions-integration.spec.ts` | `/transactions` → `/finance/transactions` |
| `import-wizard.spec.ts` | `/import` → `/finance/import` |
| `import-wizard-integration.spec.ts` | `/import` → `/finance/import` |

E2E tests move to `apps/pops-shell/e2e/` since they test the integrated app, not individual packages. Fixtures and helpers move with them.

### R10: Cleanup

- Delete `apps/pops-pwa/` entirely after all code is extracted
- Update `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to include `packages/app-finance`
- Update Turbo config if needed
- Update mise tasks referencing `pops-pwa`
- Update Docker/nginx configs to build from `apps/pops-shell/`
- Update CLAUDE.md

## Out of Scope

- Full app switcher redesign (PRD-003)
- API rename (Epic 3)
- New apps (Phase 2)
- New components
- Responsive design (Epic 5)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `apps/pops-shell/` is the single frontend entry point
2. `packages/app-finance/` contains all finance pages and domain components
3. `apps/pops-pwa/` is deleted
4. Routes are namespaced under `/finance/*`
5. `/` redirects to `/finance`
6. Navigating to a non-existent route shows a styled 404 page within the shell layout (not a React crash screen)
7. TopBar and sidebar nav remain fixed on screen while page content scrolls — at any scroll position on any page
8. All drill-down pages have a back button (ArrowLeft) and breadcrumb trail in the page header
9. Top-level (sidebar-accessible) pages show neither a back button nor breadcrumbs
10. Sidebar shows Finance nav items driven by the app's exported navConfig
11. Lazy loading works — finance routes are code-split (verify in network tab)
8. `pnpm dev` starts one Vite server
9. `pnpm build` produces one output with code splitting
10. `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format:check`, `pnpm test` all pass
11. All E2E tests pass with updated routes
12. Storybook discovers stories from both `@pops/ui` and `@pops/app-finance`
13. Docker/nginx/deployment configs updated and working

## Edge Cases & Decisions

**Q: Where does InventoryPage live?**
A: In `@pops/app-finance` for now. It moves to `@pops/app-inventory` when that app is built in Phase 2. Don't prematurely extract it.

**Q: Where do E2E tests live?**
A: In `apps/pops-shell/e2e/`. E2E tests exercise the integrated system, not individual packages. Unit tests for finance components stay in `packages/app-finance/`.

**Q: What about the tRPC AppRouter type import?**
A: Stays as `import type { AppRouter } from '@pops/api'` until Epic 3 renames the API. The shell owns the tRPC client; app packages use tRPC hooks via the shell's provider.

**Q: How do app packages access tRPC?**
A: The shell provides the tRPC context via React providers. App packages import the `trpc` object from the shell (or from a shared package). The simplest approach: the shell re-exports `trpc` from a known import path, and app packages list `@pops/shell` as a peer dependency. Alternative: extract `trpc` into a tiny shared package. Decide during implementation based on what's cleaner.

**Q: Do app packages depend on the shell?**
A: No circular deps. App packages depend on `@pops/ui` and `@pops/db-types`. The shell depends on app packages. For tRPC access, either: (a) the shell passes `trpc` down via context/props, (b) a separate `@pops/trpc` package holds the client config, or (c) app packages list `@pops/shell` as a peer dep. Option (b) is cleanest if it becomes an issue.

## User Stories

> **Standard verification — applies to every US below:**
> Each story is only done when `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format:check`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm build` all pass.

### US-1: Create shell package scaffold

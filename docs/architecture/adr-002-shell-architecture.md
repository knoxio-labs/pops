# ADR-002: Shell Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

POPS is a multi-app platform (finance, media, inventory, fitness, etc.) that needs a frontend architecture supporting:

- Multiple apps with independent pages and domain components
- Shared shell (layout, navigation, app switcher, theming)
- Shared UI component library
- One dev server, not one per app
- Fast load times via code splitting
- Single Storybook instance covering all packages

## Options Considered

| Option                                     | Pros                                                               | Cons                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single SPA with lazy-loaded routes         | One dev server, shared runtime, simple deployment                  | All code in one package.json, monolith creep as apps grow                        |
| Module Federation (separate Vite builds)   | Independent builds/deploys, true isolation                         | Runtime overhead, multiple dev servers, version skew, complex infra              |
| Single SPA with workspace packages per app | One dev server, logical separation, independent testing, one build | More workspace config, still one build graph                                     |
| Next.js                                    | Built-in code splitting, file-based routing                        | SSR is pointless for single-user self-hosted PWA, adds complexity for no benefit |

## Decision

Single SPA with workspace packages per app. Each app lives in its own workspace package (`packages/app-*`). The shell imports them as dependencies. Vite resolves workspace packages natively and code-splits per route.

Key reasons:

- One dev server, one build, one Docker image
- Each app has clear boundaries (own package.json, tsconfig, tests) without Module Federation complexity
- One Storybook discovers stories from all packages via globs
- No SSR overhead for a self-hosted single-user PWA
- One developer with AI agents, not five teams — independent deploys add complexity without value

## Consequences

- New apps are scaffolded as workspace packages with a known structure
- All apps share one version of React, tRPC client, Zustand, Tailwind — no version skew
- Cross-app navigation is instant (SPA, no full page reload)
- Build time scales with total code, but Vite is fast and dev mode only processes the active route
- Apps import from `@pops/ui` and shared packages, never from other apps. Cross-app communication goes through the API or shared stores in the shell

# ADR-032: Positioning vs the Self-Hosted-OS Family

## Status

Accepted — 2026-06-13

## Context

POPS now overlaps in surface area with established self-hosted platforms — Home Assistant / HassOS, Umbrel, CasaOS, YunoHost, Cloudron. The pillar architecture (ADR-026), the runtime registry (ADR-027), the contract packages (ADR-030), and the federated SDK have produced something that looks superficially like an "app platform OS." Before investing further effort in BE-lego deliverables (per-pillar registration endpoint, nginx generator, public contract publishing, starter-template repo, optional ISO distribution), the question of whether POPS is reinventing wheels or producing differentiated value needs an explicit answer that survives until cerebrum engrams can hold it as durable memory.

The framing question: _are we building HA with extra steps, or are we building something the self-hosted-OS family does not have?_

## Decision

POPS is positioned as a **typed federation + AI-tool platform for self-hosted apps**, additive to (not competitive with) the HA-style integration platforms.

The differentiated layer — and the only layer worth defending — is:

1. **Type-safe SDK across pillars** with full TS inference from contract → consumer (`pillar('finance').transactions.list()`).
2. **Federated semantic search across domain pillars** (`federated-query-orchestrator` / `ranking-strategy`) with per-pillar ranking and explicit merge strategies.
3. **AI-tool routing as a first-class manifest dimension** (`dynamic-tool-list` / `tool-call-routing`) — every pillar declares its AI-callable surface; the orchestrator routes tool calls; the LLM consumes them.
4. **Per-pillar SQLite + container isolation** as the unit of work — not shared DB, not shared process. This is what makes BE-lego (ADR-026 culmination) structurally possible.
5. **Contract-first publishing with codegen** (`type-generation-pipeline`, OpenAPI per pillar, manifest generated) so external pillars and non-TS consumers can integrate with strong types.

The undifferentiated layer (container orchestration, nginx routing, deployment lifecycle, single-machine app management) is acknowledged as rebuilt infrastructure. It is kept because the cost is sunk and replacing it would also require abandoning the differentiated layer, but no further investment is made in catching up to HassOS supervisor or Umbrel app-store ergonomics.

Integration with the device-/sensor-/automation-side of self-hosting is delegated to HA (and similar) via **bridge pillars**: thin POPS pillars whose job is to subscribe to an upstream system (HA WebSocket, MQTT broker, ESPHome devices) and expose the data through POPS's normal search adapter / AI tool surfaces. Bridge pillars are also the route for outbound flows — POPS publishing events to HA or MQTT becomes a manifest "sinks" dimension (future PRD).

The "POPS OS" framing is reduced to a **packaging variant**: the same codebase can ship as a HassOS-style single-purpose ISO (the appliance distribution) or as a docker-compose stack on existing infra (the container distribution). The container distribution is the daily-driver shape. The ISO is optional demo material for the writeup, not a separate project.

## Consequences

- **Enables:** continued investment in SDK / federation / AI-tool work; bridge pillar pattern as the way device integration enters POPS; writeup framing ("typed federation for self-hosted apps") as a category POPS plants the flag on.
- **Enables:** Rust / Go / Python pillars as a near-term possibility — the contract codegen + manifest pattern makes language-agnostic pillars achievable in weeks once the public registration endpoint lands.
- **Prevents:** scope-creep into device-driver work, voice-assistant work, entity-model standardization, app-store UX work. These are all real and important, but they are HassOS's / HA's / Umbrel's job.
- **Constrains:** every new feature must be evaluated against "does this strengthen the typed-federation story?" Features that compete with HA on its turf (more integrations, better voice, more devices) get a hard no.
- **Trade-off accepted:** POPS will look less feature-rich than HA to a casual evaluator. The audience is not the HA-shopping homeowner; it is the developer / researcher / typed-platform enthusiast who wants the federation surface and is happy to wire HA in as their integration provider.
- **Trade-off accepted:** the container distribution remains the canonical deployment shape. The "POPS OS" ISO becomes demo material rather than a separate maintained product.

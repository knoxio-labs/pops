# ADR-033: Cross-Language Pillar Contracts via OpenAPI

## Status

Accepted — 2026-06-13

## Context

[ADR-032](adr-032-positioning-vs-self-hosted-os-family.md) commits POPS to the "external pillar in any language drops in and works" vision. The natural-fit pillar today is TypeScript on Node — it imports `@pops/pillar-sdk`, exposes a tRPC router, gets typed consumers for free. A pillar written in Rust, Go, or Python cannot use any of that. Yet the value of the architecture is undermined if the differentiated layer (typed federation across pillars) only works for TS pillars.

The question: how does a non-TS pillar publish a typed contract that TS consumers can call, AND how does a TS pillar's contract get consumed from a non-TS pillar (e.g. a Rust pillar that wants to call `pillar('finance').transactions.list(...)`)?

Three constraints shape the answer:

1. POPS already emits an OpenAPI snapshot per pillar (per `type-generation-pipeline`, all 7 pillars). The codegen pipeline exists.
2. tRPC's wire format is JSON-over-HTTP — language-agnostic at the bytes-on-the-wire level, even though the TS consumer experience is the differentiator.
3. The audience for cross-language pillars is small and motivated. They will accept some manual codegen step in exchange for being able to ship in their preferred language.

## Decision

The OpenAPI snapshot is the canonical cross-language pillar contract. Every pillar publishes `openapi/<pillar>.openapi.json` as part of its contract package (already true per `type-generation-pipeline`). Cross-language consumers and producers use language-appropriate OpenAPI codegen against that snapshot.

For TS-to-TS consumption, the existing `@pops/<pillar>-contract` package with tRPC types remains the canonical path — it stays the strongest-typed surface. The OpenAPI snapshot is the fallback / external-language surface.

For cross-language pillar authoring (a Rust pillar that exposes its own router):

1. The Rust pillar authors a contract repo (`pops-finance-contract-rs` for example) that publishes the same `openapi.json` + a tRPC-compatible JSON-over-HTTP server impl.
2. The OpenAPI must conform to the same REST shape the [type-generation-pipeline](../themes/federation/prds/type-generation-pipeline.md) emits: value-direct success bodies and a `{ message, code? }` error body on real HTTP status codes, with each operation's `operationId = "<domain>.<proc>"`. The full wire conventions are documented in the [cross-language wire-format spec](../themes/federation/prds/cross-language-wire-format-spec.md).
3. The pillar registers with `POST /registry/register` (legacy alias `/core.registry.register`) advertising its baseUrl + manifest.
4. TS consumers see no difference — they call `pillar('rust-thing').something.list(...)` through the SDK proxy; the proxy treats the response identically.

No per-language SDK is maintained by the POPS project. The [cross-language wire-format spec](../themes/federation/prds/cross-language-wire-format-spec.md) is the contract the language ecosystem implements against using whatever OpenAPI tooling already exists in that language. The Rust `contacts` pillar is the live proof it is implementable.

## Consequences

- **Enables:** language-agnostic pillar authoring — shipped. The [wire-format spec](../themes/federation/prds/cross-language-wire-format-spec.md) documents the contract and the Rust `contacts` pillar federates live against it.
- **Enables:** the OpenAPI snapshot becomes the public contract surface even for TS consumers in external repos that don't want to npm-install the contract package.
- **Prevents:** language-specific SDK ports owned by POPS. Anyone wanting an idiomatic Rust SDK builds it themselves on top of the OpenAPI spec.
- **Constrains:** the wire format must remain stable. Breaking changes to the success/error envelope, status-code mapping, or registry handshake become breaking for every cross-language consumer simultaneously. Versioning becomes a hard contract semver (per ADR-030).
- **Trade-off accepted:** non-TS consumers get a weaker typing experience (OpenAPI-generated types are coarser than the in-tree TS contract's inference). They get language idiomaticity in exchange. This is the right trade for the audience.
- **Trade-off accepted:** the wire-format spec is a load-bearing artifact. It is the source of truth for cross-language interop, more so than any single TS implementation.

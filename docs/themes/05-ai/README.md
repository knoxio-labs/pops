> Make POPS proactive — categorise, assist, and surface insights automatically.

## Strategic Objective

Build three layers of AI capability: categorisation (automated data entry and matching), overlay (contextual assistant in the shell), and inference (proactive monitoring, anomaly detection, alerts). AI usage spans all domains — cost tracking, token budgets, and model configuration belong in a central hub, not embedded in individual apps.

## Success Criteria

- AI operations app provides visibility into usage, costs, and cache hit rates across all domains
- Categorisation reduces manual data entry over time as the system learns
- Overlay assistant can query across domains and suggest actions contextually
- Inference surfaces anomalies and insights before the user asks

## Epics

| #   | Epic                                               | Summary                                                                                 | Status      |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 0   | [AI Operations App](epics/00-ai-operations-app.md) | `@pops/app-ai` — usage tracking, cost visualisation, model config, categorisation rules | Partial     |
| 1   | [AI Overlay](epics/01-ai-overlay.md)               | Contextual assistant in the shell — query across domains, suggest actions               | Not started |
| 2   | [AI Inference](epics/02-ai-inference.md)           | Proactive monitoring, anomaly detection, Moltbot alerts, scheduled analysis             | Not started |

Epic 0 is Phase 2. Epics 1-2 are Phase 3 — they need multiple domains with real data to be useful.

## Key Decisions

| Decision         | Choice                      | Rationale                                           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| AI provider      | Claude Haiku                | Cheap (~$1-5/month), good enough for categorisation |
| Caching          | Disk cache per domain       | Avoid repeat API calls for same inputs              |
| Operations scope | Platform-level, not per-app | AI usage is a cross-cutting concern                 |

## Risks

- **AI cost creep** — More domains = more API calls. Mitigation: aggressive caching, corrections reduce AI dependency over time
- **Overlay complexity** — Cross-domain queries need a unified data model. Mitigation: start simple, use universal object URIs (ADR-010)
- **Inference noise** — Too many alerts become spam. Mitigation: configurable thresholds, start conservative

## Out of Scope

- Training custom models
- Local/on-device inference
- General-purpose chatbot (overlay is POPS-specific)

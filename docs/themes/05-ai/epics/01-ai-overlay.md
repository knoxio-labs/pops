# Epic 01: AI Overlay

> Theme: [AI](../README.md)

## Scope

Build a contextual AI assistant integrated into the shell. Knows which app the user is in, can query across domains via universal object URIs (ADR-012), and suggests actions. Interactive — "help me do it."

- General-purpose chatbot (overlay is POPS-specific)

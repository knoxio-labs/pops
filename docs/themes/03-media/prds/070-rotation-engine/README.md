# PRD-070: Rotation Engine

> Epic: [Library Rotation](../../epics/08-library-rotation.md)

## Overview

The rotation engine is a daily automated job that manages the movie library lifecycle. Disk space is the primary driver: the system removes enough old movies to stay below a target free-space threshold, then adds new movies from the candidate queue if space permits. Removals go through a "leaving soon" grace period before files are actually deleted via Radarr. The number of movies removed or added on any given day is variable — entirely determined by disk usage.

## Data Model

## API Surface

### Internal (used by the cron job, not exposed as tRPC)

- `runRotationCycle()` — orchestrates the full daily cycle
- `getRadarrDiskSpace()` → free space in GB via Radarr `/api/v3/diskspace`
- `getRadarrMovieSizes()` → map of Radarr movie ID → `sizeOnDisk` in GB (from Radarr `/api/v3/movie`)
- `calculateRemovalCount(freeSpaceGb, targetFreeGb, pendingLeavingGb)` → how many additional movies to mark leaving to reach the target, accounting for movies already in the leaving pipeline
- `getEligibleForRemoval()` → all eligible movies ordered by `created_at` ASC, excluding watchlist items, `protected` movies, movies already `leaving`, and movies currently downloading in Radarr. Includes `sizeOnDisk` from Radarr for each.
- `markAsLeaving(movieIds, expiryDate)` — sets `rotation_status = 'leaving'`
- `processExpiredMovies()` — finds `leaving` movies past `rotation_expires_at`, calls Radarr delete with `deleteFiles=true`
- `addFromQueue(count)` — picks from candidate queue (PRD-071), calls Radarr add with `searchForMovie: true`

### tRPC (exposed to UI)

- `rotation.getConfig` — current rotation settings
- `rotation.updateConfig` — update settings (partial)
- `rotation.getStatus` — current state: next run, last run summary, disk space, leaving count
- `rotation.getLeavingSoon` — movies with `rotation_status = 'leaving'`, sorted by `rotation_expires_at`
- `rotation.getLog` — paginated rotation execution history
- `rotation.runNow` — manually trigger a rotation cycle
- `rotation.cancelLeaving(movieId)` — clear leaving status, return to active pool

## Business Rules

- **Disk space drives removals:** The system calculates how much space needs to be freed: `deficit = rotation_target_free_gb - current_free_space_gb - pending_leaving_space_gb`. If `deficit > 0`, it marks the oldest eligible movies as leaving until the cumulative `sizeOnDisk` of newly marked movies covers the deficit. If `deficit ≤ 0`, no new movies are marked leaving this cycle. "Pending leaving space" accounts for movies already in the `leaving` state whose expiry hasn't hit yet — their space will be reclaimed soon, so they count toward the budget.
- **Removal selection order:** Eligible movies are ordered by `created_at` ASC (oldest first). The system walks this list, accumulating `sizeOnDisk`, until the deficit is covered. This is deterministic, not random — the oldest movies go first.
- **Eligibility exclusions:** Movies on the user's watchlist, movies with `rotation_status = 'protected'` (unexpired), movies already `leaving`, and movies currently downloading in Radarr are all excluded from removal selection.
- **Leaving grace period:** Marked movies stay in the library for `rotation_leaving_days` (default 10). During this period they appear in the "Leaving Soon" shelf. After expiry, they are deleted from Radarr with `deleteFiles=true`.
- **Expired movie processing:** Each cycle first processes all expired leaving movies (deletes from Radarr), then recalculates free space, then decides whether to mark more movies as leaving.
- **Watchlist protection:** Any movie on the user's watchlist is permanently ineligible for rotation. If a movie is marked `leaving` and then added to the watchlist, the leaving status is immediately cleared.
- **Manual download protection:** Movies added via the "Download" action (bypassing the queue) get `rotation_status = 'protected'` with `rotation_expires_at` set to `now + rotation_protected_days`. After expiry, status clears to `null` (eligible).
- **Addition gating:** After removals, if free space ≥ `rotation_target_free_gb`, add up to `rotation_daily_additions` movies from the candidate queue. If free space is still below target (not enough expired movies freed space yet), skip additions entirely.
- **Movie size data:** Each movie's `sizeOnDisk` comes from Radarr's `/api/v3/movie` response. If a movie isn't in Radarr (removed externally), fall back to `rotation_avg_movie_gb` as an estimate.
- **No compounding on total failure:** If the entire cycle fails (Radarr unreachable), log the failure and skip. Do not carry over missed removals/additions to the next day.
- **Cycle order:** Process expired deletions → measure free space → mark new leaving movies → measure free space again → add from queue.

## Edge Cases

| Case                                                      | Behaviour                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Deficit requires more removals than eligible movies       | Mark all eligible as leaving, log the shortfall. Remaining deficit carries naturally to next cycle (free space will still be below target) |
| Deficit is 0 or negative (plenty of space)                | Skip marking, no new leaving movies this cycle                                                                                             |
| No candidates in queue for addition                       | Skip additions, log "queue empty"                                                                                                          |
| Radarr unreachable at cycle start                         | Log `skipped_reason = 'radarr_unreachable'`, skip entire cycle                                                                             |
| Movie deleted from Radarr externally                      | Removal succeeds (no-op on Radarr side), clear from POPS                                                                                   |
| Movie marked leaving but re-added to watchlist            | Clear leaving status immediately (watchlist router calls rotation service)                                                                 |
| Disk space endpoint returns multiple disks                | Use the disk where the Radarr root folder lives                                                                                            |
| Rotation disabled mid-cycle                               | Complete current cycle, don't schedule next                                                                                                |
| All movies are watchlisted or protected                   | 0 eligible for removal, log and skip. Additions still proceed if space permits                                                             |
| Single large movie (e.g., 80GB 4K) covers entire deficit  | Mark just that one movie — removal count is driven by bytes, not count                                                                     |
| Radarr `sizeOnDisk` is 0 for a movie (not yet downloaded) | Skip it — no space to reclaim. It will be picked up once it has files                                                                      |

## Out of Scope

- TV show rotation
- Smart removal selection based on ratings/comparisons (future enhancement)
- Multi-instance Radarr support
- Notification system (email/push when movies are leaving)

> Epic: [02 — App Package & Core UI](../../epics/02-app-package-ui.md)
> Status: Done

## Overview

Build the TV show detail page with season list and episode drill-down. Display show metadata, overall and per-season watch progress, season cards, and a separate season detail route with full episode lists and per-episode watch toggles.

## Routes

## API Dependencies

| Procedure                     | Usage                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `media.library.getTvShow`     | Fetch full show metadata with season list              |
| `media.library.getSeason`     | Fetch season metadata with episode list                |
| `media.watchHistory.progress` | Get overall + per-season watch stats for a show        |
| `media.watchHistory.log`      | Log a single episode watch event                       |
| `media.watchHistory.delete`   | Delete a single episode watch event (toggle unwatched) |
| `media.watchHistory.batchLog` | Log watch events for multiple episodes at once         |
| `media.watchlist.status`      | Check if show is on watchlist                          |
| `media.watchlist.add`         | Add show to watchlist                                  |
| `media.watchlist.remove`      | Remove show from watchlist                             |

## Business Rules

- Year range displays as "Start – End" for ended shows, "Start – Present" for continuing shows, "Start" only for single-season shows that have ended
- Watch progress is calculated from `watchHistory.progress(tvShowId)` which returns both overall and per-season breakdowns
- "Next episode" is the first unwatched episode in air-date order across all seasons
- "Mark All Watched" and "Mark Season Watched" use `batchLog` — a single API call, not one per episode
- Per-episode watch toggle is optimistic — the checkmark appears/disappears immediately
- Specials (season 0) are listed last in the season list, not first
- Season detail page shows episode air dates; episodes that have not aired yet are visually distinct (dimmed, "Upcoming" label)

## Edge Cases

| Case                              | Behaviour                                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Show not found (invalid ID)       | 404 page or redirect to library                                             |
| Season not found (invalid number) | 404 page or redirect to show detail                                         |
| Show with no seasons              | Empty season list with message ("No seasons available")                     |
| Season with no episodes           | Empty episode list with message ("No episodes available")                   |
| All episodes watched              | Progress bar at 100% (green), "Mark All Watched" button hidden or disabled  |
| Episode has not aired yet         | Dimmed row, "Upcoming" label, watch toggle disabled                         |
| Show still airing (new episodes)  | Progress denominator updates as new episodes are added via metadata refresh |
| Batch mark watched fails          | Revert optimistic updates for all affected episodes, error toast            |

## User Stories

| #   | Story                                                   | Summary                                                                                          | Status | Parallelisable            |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------- |
| 01  | [us-01-show-hero-metadata](us-01-show-hero-metadata.md) | Hero layout with backdrop, poster, title, year range, status, genres, networks, overview         | Done   | No (first)                |
| 02  | [us-02-season-list](us-02-season-list.md)               | Season cards with poster, number, episode count, per-season progress bar, click to season detail | Done   | Blocked by us-01          |
| 03  | [us-03-season-detail-page](us-03-season-detail-page.md) | Season detail route, episode list with watch status toggles, mark season watched                 | Done   | Yes (parallel with us-02) |
| 04  | [us-04-watch-progress](us-04-watch-progress.md)         | Watch progress display (overall + per-season bars), next episode indicator, batch mark watched   | Done   | Yes (parallel with us-02) |

US-02 depends on US-01 (needs the page shell). US-03 and US-04 are independent components that can be built in parallel with US-02 after the route structure is established.

## Verification

- Hero section renders with all show metadata
- Year range formats correctly for ended, continuing, and single-season shows
- Season list displays all seasons with correct episode counts and progress bars
- Clicking a season card navigates to the season detail page
- Season detail page lists all episodes with correct watch status
- Per-episode watch toggle updates optimistically
- "Mark Season Watched" batch-logs all unwatched episodes in one call
- "Mark All Watched" batch-logs all unwatched episodes across all seasons
- Next episode indicator points to the correct episode
- Overall progress bar updates after watch events
- Specials listed last, unaired episodes are dimmed and non-toggleable

## Out of Scope

- Editing show/season/episode metadata
- Removing a show from the library
- Cast/crew information
- Episode ratings or comparisons
- Recommendations for similar shows (Epic 05)

# PRD-065: Shelf-Based Discovery

> Epic: [05 — Discovery & Recommendations](../../epics/05-discovery-recommendations.md)
> Status: In progress

## Overview

A dynamic shelf pool system for the discover page. Instead of showing the same 9 hardcoded sections in the same order every time, the page is assembled per session from a pool of 27 shelf definitions. Each session selects 10-15 shelves, orders them by relevance and variety, and jitters item positions within each shelf. The result: a Netflix-like experience where the page feels different every time you open it.

## Shelf System Architecture

### Shelf interface

```typescript
interface ShelfDefinition {
  id: string;                                // "because-you-watched", "hidden-gems", etc.
  template: boolean;                         // true = parametrized (generates multiple instances)
  category: "seed" | "profile" | "tmdb" | "local" | "context" | "external";
  generate(profile: PreferenceProfile): ShelfInstance[];  // one instance per seed, or one for static
}

interface ShelfInstance {
  shelfId: string;                           // "because-you-watched:42" or "hidden-gems"
  title: string;                             // "Because you watched Interstellar"
  subtitle?: string;                         // "Movies similar to your recent watch"
  emoji?: string;                            // "🎬" for theming
  query(options: { limit: number; offset: number }): Promise<DiscoverResult[]>;
  score: number;                             // relevance to this user (0-1)
  seedMovieId?: number;                      // for seed-based shelves
}
```

### Shelf pool (27 definitions)

#### Seed-based templates (8 — each generates multiple instances)

| ID | Template | Seed source | TMDB endpoint |
|----|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `because-you-watched` | "Because you watched {Movie}" | Recent watches (weighted toward last 30 days, random older) | `/movie/{id}/recommendations` |
| `more-from-director` | "More from {Director}" | Directors of high-ELO movies | `/discover/movie?with_crew={id}` |
| `more-from-actor` | "More from {Actor}" | Lead actors of top-rated movies | `/discover/movie?with_cast={id}` |
| `best-in-genre` | "Best in {Genre}" | Genres from affinity profile | `/discover/movie?with_genres={id}&sort_by=vote_average.desc` |
| `genre-crossover` | "{Genre} × {Genre}" | Top genre pairs (not related) | `/discover/movie?with_genres={id1},{id2}` |
| `top-dimension` | "Top {Dimension} picks" | ELO dimensions | Local: movies ranked highest on that dimension |
| `dimension-inspired` | "You loved {Movie}'s {Dimension}" | High-scoring movie + dimension | `/movie/{id}/recommendations` filtered by dimension affinity |
| `context` | "{Context Title}" | Time/date/season triggers | `/discover/movie?with_genres={ids}&with_keywords={ids}` |

#### Static shelves (19)

| ID | Title | Source | Query logic |
|----|-------|--------|-------------|
| `trending-tmdb` | "Trending" | TMDB | `/trending/movie/{week\|day}` |
| `trending-plex` | "Trending on Plex" | Plex Discover | Cloud trending, hidden if disconnected |
| `new-releases` | "New Releases" | TMDB | Released in last 30 days, filtered by genre affinity |
| `hidden-gems` | "Hidden Gems" | TMDB | Vote count 50-500, vote average > 7.0, in top genres |
| `critics-vs-audiences` | "Critics Love, Audiences Split" | TMDB | High vote average + low popularity (proxy for polarizing) |
| `short-watch` | "Quick Watch" | Local | Runtime < 100min, unwatched, scored |
| `long-epic` | "Epic Watch" | Local | Runtime > 150min, unwatched, scored |
| `worth-rewatching` | "Worth Rewatching" | Local | Watched 6+ months ago, above-median ELO |
| `from-your-server` | "Ready on Your Server" | Local | Unwatched library, scored by profile |
| `from-your-watchlist` | "From Your Watchlist" | Local + TMDB | Similar to recent watchlist items |
| `franchise-completions` | "Finish the Series" | TMDB Collections | Partially watched collections (e.g. 2 of 3 LOTR) |
| `recently-added` | "Recently Added" | Local | Newest by created_at, unwatched |
| `award-winners` | "Award Winners" | TMDB | Keywords: academy award, golden globe, in top genres |
| `decade-picks` | "Best of the {Decade}" | TMDB | Year range of decade with most watches |
| `comfort-picks` | "Comfort Picks" | Local | Watched 2+ times or frequently draw-high'd |
| `polarizing` | "Love It or Hate It" | Local | High variance across ELO dimensions |
| `undiscovered` | "Undiscovered in Your Library" | Local | In library, zero comparisons, unwatched |
| `friend-proof` | "Crowd Pleasers" | Local | High Entertainment + high Rewatchability dimensions |
| `recommendations` | "Recommended for You" | Local + TMDB | Top ELO movies → TMDB recs, merged, scored (existing logic) |

## Session Assembly Algorithm

Each page load runs the assembly:

1. **Generate instances**: call `generate()` on all 27 shelf definitions → ~50-100 shelf instances
2. **Filter empty**: discard instances where `query()` would return 0 results (fast pre-check)
3. **Score each instance**: 
   - Relevance: user affinity score (0-1)
   - Freshness: `1 / (1 + timesShownRecently)` from `shelf_impressions` table
   - Variety bonus: +0.2 if category differs from already-selected shelves
4. **Select 10-15 shelves**: weighted random sampling from scored instances
5. **Order**: highest-scoring first, but with variety constraint — no two shelves from same category adjacent
6. **Jitter items**: within each shelf, multiply each item's score by random [0.8, 1.2] before sorting
7. **Record impressions**: log which shelves were shown in `shelf_impressions`

### Variety constraints

- Maximum 3 seed-based shelves per session
- Maximum 2 genre-related shelves (best-in-genre, genre-crossover)
- Maximum 1 local-only shelf per 3 shelves (mix in TMDB shelves between)
- Always include at least 1 "Recommended for You" or "Because you watched" (personal relevance anchor)
- Context shelves (time-based) get a +0.3 relevance boost when active

## Data Model

### shelf_impressions

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `id` | INTEGER | PK, auto-increment | |
| `shelf_id` | TEXT | NOT NULL | e.g. "because-you-watched:42", "hidden-gems" |
| `shown_at` | TEXT | NOT NULL | ISO timestamp |

Index on `shelf_id`. Used to compute freshness — shelves shown recently score lower.

Cleanup: rows older than 30 days are deleted on startup or periodically.

## Business Rules

- Session assembly runs on every page load (no caching the shelf selection)
- Item positions within shelves are jittered — same shelf shows different item order each time
- Seed selection for "Because you watched" rotates: 60% from last 30 days watches, 40% random older
- Director/actor shelves require the movie to have TMDB credits data (fetched lazily, cached)
- Franchise detection uses TMDB's `/movie/{id}` response `belongs_to_collection` field
- "Comfort picks" counts watch events — 2+ completed watches of the same movie = comfort
- "Polarizing" measures score variance: `MAX(score) - MIN(score)` across dimensions, threshold > 200 points
- Shelves with fewer than 3 results are discarded during filtering
- The preference profile (genre affinity, dimension weights) is computed once per session and shared across all shelf scorers
- Dismissed movies are filtered from all shelves (existing dismissed_discover table)

## Edge Cases

| Case | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| New user, no watches | Only trending, new releases, context shelves shown. No seed-based shelves |
| Small library (< 10 movies) | Local shelves may be empty — filter them out, lean on TMDB shelves |
| No comparisons | Dimension-based shelves hidden, genre shelves use watch distribution instead of ELO |
| TMDB API failure | Affected shelves silently removed from session. Local shelves unaffected |
| Plex disconnected | Plex shelf hidden (existing behavior) |
| All shelves shown recently (low freshness) | Freshness weight floors at 0.1 (never zero), least-recently-shown shelves win |
| Session takes > 2s to assemble | Pre-check queries should be fast. If slow, reduce candidate pool to 30 instances |

US-01 and US-03 can parallelise. US-04 through US-09 (all shelf implementations) can parallelise after US-01. US-10 through US-13 are sequential.

## Out of Scope

- TV show shelves (movie-only for now)
- Collaborative filtering (requires multi-user data)
- AI-generated shelf titles or descriptions
- Editorial/curated shelves (all algorithmic)
- Streaming availability data (no API integration with Netflix/etc.)

# PRD-050: Warranty Tracking

> Epic: [05 — Warranty, Value & Reporting](../../epics/05-warranty-value-reporting.md)
> Status: Partial

## Overview

Build a warranties page with urgency tiers. Surface items approaching warranty expiry with colour-coded urgency. Group by status: expired, expiring soon (multiple tiers), active.

## Route

`/inventory/warranties`

## Urgency Tiers

| Tier | Condition | Colour | Default State |
|------|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Expiring Soon (<30 days) | 0 < daysRemaining <= 30 | Red | Always expanded |
| Expiring Soon (30-60 days) | 30 < daysRemaining <= 60 | Yellow/Orange | Always expanded |
| Expiring Soon (60-90 days) | 60 < daysRemaining <= 90 | Orange | Always expanded |
| Active (>90 days) | daysRemaining > 90 | Green | Collapsible, expanded by default |
| Expired | daysRemaining <= 0 | Grey/Muted | Collapsible, collapsed by default |

Tiers calculated from `currentDate - item.warrantyExpiry`. Sorted within each tier by expiry date ascending (most urgent first).

## Item Row

Each item in any tier shows:

- Item name, asset ID, brand/model
- Warranty expiry date (formatted)
- Days remaining (e.g., "12 days left") or "Expired X days ago"
- Link to item detail page
- Link to warranty document (if linked via Paperless — uses `item_documents` with tag "warranty")

## API Surface

| Procedure | Input | Output | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------|
| `inventory.warranties.list` | (none) | `{ data: WarrantyItem[] }` | All items with `warrantyExpiry` set, includes computed `daysRemaining` and `tier` |

The endpoint returns all items with warranty dates in a single call. Tier assignment and sorting happen server-side.

## Business Rules

- Only items with `warrantyExpiry` set appear on this page
- Items with no warranty date are excluded entirely
- Tiers calculated from current date vs `warrantyExpiry`
- "Days remaining" is `warrantyExpiry - today` in calendar days
- Expired items show negative days as "Expired X days ago"
- Warranty document link only appears if an `item_documents` row exists with tag "warranty" for that item

## Edge Cases

| Case | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| No items with warranty dates | Empty state: "No warranties tracked — add warranty dates to your items" |
| All warranties expired | Only Expired tier shown (expanded since it's the only group) |
| Warranty expires today | daysRemaining = 0, placed in "<30 days" tier |
| Tier has no items | Tier heading hidden |
| Item has warranty date but no warranty document | Row renders normally, warranty document link absent |

## User Stories

| # | Story | Summary | Status | Parallelisable |
|---|-------|---------|--------|----------------|
| 01 | [us-01-warranty-tiers](us-01-warranty-tiers.md) | Warranty page with urgency tiers, colour coding, collapsible sections, sort by expiry | Partial | No (first) |
| 02 | [us-02-warranty-items](us-02-warranty-items.md) | Item rows with name/assetId/brand/model, expiry date, days remaining, detail + document links | Partial | Blocked by us-01 |
| 03 | [us-03-warranty-empty-states](us-03-warranty-empty-states.md) | Page-level and per-tier empty states, edge case handling | Done | Blocked by us-01 |

US-02 and US-03 can parallelise after US-01.

## Out of Scope

- Warranty expiry notifications or push alerts
- Automated warranty date extraction from receipts
- Extended warranty purchase tracking
- Depreciation calculations

# Theme: Inventory

> Know what I own, where it is, and what it's connected to.

## Strategic Objective

Build a home inventory app that tracks every physical item — from a $5,000 MacBook to a $3 HDMI cable — with photos, specs, warranty dates, purchase links, and receipt attachments. The core model is a physical connectivity graph on a hierarchical location tree. The system answers "where is it?", "is it under warranty?", "what's plugged into this power board?", and "what's the total replacement value?" without thinking.

## Success Criteria

- Full CRUD for items with rich metadata (brand, model, condition, purchase date, warranty, replacement value, notes)
- Bidirectional item connections track physical links (cables to devices, power supplies to power boards)
- Location tree supports arbitrary depth with multiple roots (Home, Car, Storage Cage)
- Custom asset IDs (HDMI01, ROUTER01) are first-class searchable identifiers
- Photos uploadable and viewable per item
- Receipts/warranties link to Paperless-ngx documents
- Purchase transactions and entities link items to the finance domain
- Warranty expiry alerts surface proactively
- Connection chain tracing from wall outlet to devices
- Insurance-ready reports with item list, values, photos, and receipts

## Key Decisions

| Decision       | Choice                                 | Rationale                                                             |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Location model | Self-referential tree (`parent_id`)    | Arbitrary depth, multiple roots                                       |
| Connections    | Untyped bidirectional junction table   | Item metadata carries semantic meaning, no connection types needed    |
| Asset IDs      | First-class unique text field          | Human-readable prefixes (HDMI01, ETHER04) for physical identification |
| Photos         | Local filesystem, compressed on upload | Max 1920px, ~500 MB budget                                            |
| Borrowed items | Location-based ("Friend X" as root)    | Handles 80% case, proper lending system is future                     |
| Notes          | Free-form text, rendered as markdown   | Rich specs per item                                                   |
| Paperless-ngx  | Read-only (search + link)              | No upload from POPS                                                   |

## Risks

- **Location tree setup effort** — Initial 4-5 level deep tree is tedious. Mitigation: seed from imports, incremental after that
- **Connection graph complexity** — 100+ items gets visually overwhelming. Mitigation: flat list is MVP, graph is stretch goal
- **Paperless-ngx API stability** — Community project. Mitigation: isolate behind service interface
- **Scope creep toward asset management** — This is personal inventory, not enterprise CMDB

## Out of Scope

- Barcode/QR code scanning
- Depreciation or financial asset tracking (finance domain)
- Lending/borrowing system with reminders
- Automated item discovery (network scanning)
- Insurance claim submission
- Maintenance scheduling (separate theme)
- Connection types (power, data, audio)

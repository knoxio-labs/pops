# Epic 04: CI/CD Pipelines

> Theme: [Infrastructure](../README.md)

## Scope

GitHub Actions workflows for quality gates (typecheck, lint, test, build) and automated deployment. Merges to main auto-deploy to the server via a self-hosted runner. Smart deploy detects what changed and only rebuilds/restarts affected services.

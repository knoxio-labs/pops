# PRD-061: Smart Deploy Pipeline

> Epic: [04 — CI/CD Pipelines](../../epics/04-cicd-pipelines.md)
> Status: Done

## Overview

Build a deploy pipeline that detects which services changed and only rebuilds/restarts what's necessary. Skip deployment entirely for docs-only or CI-only changes. Reduce deploy time from ~5 minutes (full rebuild) to seconds (selective restart) for typical frontend or backend changes.

## Current State

Every merge to main triggers a full Ansible deploy that:
1. Git pulls the entire repo on the server
2. Templates the docker-compose.yml
3. Builds ALL custom Docker images (pops-api, pops-shell)
4. Pulls ALL third-party images (metabase, paperless, moltbot, cloudflared)
5. Restarts ALL services via `docker compose up -d`

This takes ~5 minutes regardless of what changed.

## Target State

| Change type | What happens | Expected time |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Frontend only (pops-shell, app-*, ui, navigation, widgets) | Rebuild pops-shell image, restart pops-shell container | ~1 min |
| Backend only (pops-api, db-types) | Rebuild pops-api image, restart pops-api container | ~1 min |
| Both frontend + backend | Rebuild both images, restart both containers | ~2 min |
| Infrastructure (docker-compose, ansible, nginx) | Full deploy (current behaviour) | ~5 min |
| Docs, CI workflows, or test-only changes | No deploy | 0 |

## Architecture

### Path Detection

The deploy workflow detects which paths changed between the merge commit and its parent:

| Path pattern | Category |
|-------------|----------|
| `apps/pops-shell/**`, `packages/app-*/**`, `packages/ui/**`, `packages/widgets/**`, `packages/navigation/**` | `frontend` |
| `apps/pops-api/**`, `packages/db-types/**`, `packages/types/**`, `packages/auth/**` | `backend` |
| `infra/**`, `apps/pops-shell/nginx.conf`, `docker-compose*` | `infra` |
| `docs/**`, `.github/**`, `*.md` | `skip` (no deploy) |

Multiple categories can be active (e.g., a PR touching both `apps/pops-api/` and `packages/ui/` triggers both backend and frontend).

### Selective Build + Restart

Instead of always running the full Ansible deploy playbook, the workflow directly executes Docker commands on the self-hosted runner:

```
# Only if frontend changed:
docker compose build pops-shell
docker compose up -d pops-shell

# Only if backend changed:
docker compose build pops-api
docker compose up -d pops-api

# Only if infra changed:
# Full Ansible deploy (current behaviour)
```

### Skip Deploy

If the only changes are in `docs/`, `.github/workflows/`, `*.md`, or test files, the deploy job exits early with a success status. No Docker operations at all.

### Health Check

After selective restart, verify the restarted service(s) are healthy:
- pops-api: `GET /health` returns 200
- pops-shell: nginx responds on port 80

### Fallback

If selective deploy fails (e.g., container won't start), fall back to full deploy as a recovery mechanism.

## API Dependencies

None — this is a CI/CD pipeline change, not an application feature.

## Business Rules

- Path detection uses `git diff --name-only HEAD~1..HEAD` on the merge commit
- A PR that touches both frontend and backend rebuilds both but NOT third-party images
- Infrastructure changes always trigger a full deploy (safe default)
- Unknown path patterns trigger a full deploy (safe default)
- The deploy workflow still supports manual `workflow_dispatch` which always does a full deploy
- Ansible vault secrets are only decrypted for full (infra) deploys
- Self-hosted runner executes Docker commands directly (no SSH, no Ansible for selective deploys)

## Edge Cases

| Case | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| Merge commit touches only docs | Deploy skipped entirely, job reports success |
| PR touches frontend + infra | Full deploy (infra always wins) |
| Selective restart fails health check | Falls back to full deploy |
| Manual workflow_dispatch trigger | Always full deploy |
| First deploy after runner setup | Full deploy (no previous state) |
| Docker build cache miss | Build takes longer but still selective |
| Multiple PRs merged in rapid succession | Each triggers its own deploy; Docker layer caching reduces rebuild time |

## User Stories

| # | Story | Summary | Status | Parallelisable |
|---|-------|---------|--------|----------------|
| 01 | [us-01-path-detection](us-01-path-detection.md) | Detect changed paths in merge commit, categorise as frontend/backend/infra/skip | Done | Yes |
| 02 | [us-02-selective-build](us-02-selective-build.md) | Build and restart only the changed service(s) via Docker commands | Done | Blocked by us-01 |
| 03 | [us-03-skip-deploy](us-03-skip-deploy.md) | Skip deploy entirely for docs/CI-only changes | Done | Blocked by us-01 |
| 04 | [us-04-health-check](us-04-health-check.md) | Verify restarted services are healthy, fallback to full deploy on failure | Done | Blocked by us-02 |
| 05 | [us-05-ansible-runner-provisioning](us-05-ansible-runner-provisioning.md) | Add GitHub Actions runner setup to the Ansible provisioning playbook | Done | Yes |

US-01 and US-05 can start in parallel. US-02 and US-03 depend on US-01. US-04 depends on US-02.

## Verification

- Frontend-only PR merges → only pops-shell rebuilt and restarted
- Backend-only PR merges → only pops-api rebuilt and restarted
- Docs-only PR merges → no deploy triggered
- Infra PR merges → full Ansible deploy
- Health check catches a broken container and triggers full deploy recovery
- Manual workflow_dispatch always does full deploy
- Runner provisioning via Ansible works on a fresh server

## Out of Scope

- Blue/green or canary deployments
- Rollback mechanism (revert the PR instead)
- Multi-environment deployment (staging, production)
- Container registry (images built locally on the server)
- Deployment notifications (Slack, email)

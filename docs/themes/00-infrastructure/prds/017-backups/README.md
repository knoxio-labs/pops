# PRD-017: Backups

> Epic: [05 — Backups](../../epics/05-backups.md)
> Status: Partial

## Overview

Set up encrypted offsite backups of the SQLite database, Paperless-ngx data, and configuration files to Backblaze B2 via rclone. Scheduled via systemd timers on the server.

## What Gets Backed Up

| Data                | Location      | Frequency            |
| ------------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| SQLite database     | Docker volume | Daily                |
| Paperless-ngx data  | Docker volume | Daily                |
| Media poster cache  | Docker volume | Weekly (regenerable) |
| Configuration files | `/opt/pops/`  | On change            |

## Business Rules

- All backups encrypted before upload (rclone crypt)
- Backblaze B2 bucket with versioning enabled
- Backup schedule managed by systemd timers (not cron)
- Recovery procedure documented and tested
- Backup failures should be detectable (exit codes, logs)

## User Stories

## Verification

- Backup runs successfully to B2 (visible in B2 console)
- Backed up files are encrypted (unreadable without rclone crypt config)
- Recovery procedure tested: download from B2, decrypt, restore, services start with restored data
- Systemd timer triggers daily

## Out of Scope

- Point-in-time recovery
- Multi-region replication
- Backup monitoring dashboard

# Epic 03: Corrections

> Theme: [Finance](../README.md)

## Scope

Build the corrections system — learned **classification** rules (and separate **tag** rules) that improve over time. When a user corrects a transaction, the system can propose patterns and apply them after explicit approval. Supports exact, contains, and regex pattern matching with confidence scoring and explicit priority ordering.

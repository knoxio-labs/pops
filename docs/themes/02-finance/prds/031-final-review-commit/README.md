# PRD-031: Import Final Review & Commit Step

> Epic: [01 — Import Pipeline](../../epics/01-import-pipeline.md)
> Status: Done

## Overview

Add a new Step 6 ("Final Review & Commit") between the current Tag Review (Step 5) and Summary (now Step 7). This step presents a complete summary of all pending changes — new entities, new/edited/disabled/removed rules, tag assignments, transaction counts — and commits everything atomically to the database in a single request. On commit, retroactive reclassification applies the new rules to existing DB transactions that now match (or no longer match).

**Note:** `TagReviewStep` no longer invokes `executeImport`. The `commitImport` endpoint on Step 6 is the sole writer (PRD-030 US-10 shipped in knoxio/pops#1757).

## Dependencies

- **PRD-030** (Local-First Import State Layer) provides the pending stores and commit payload builder that feed this step.
- Existing `applyChangeSet` in `service.ts` handles atomic rule application.
- Existing execute import logic in `finance/imports/router.ts` handles transaction writing.

## API Surface

### `finance.imports.commitImport`

New tRPC mutation. Accepts a full commit payload, executes all operations in a single DB transaction, returns results including retroactive reclassification counts.

**Request:**

```
CommitPayload {
  entities: Array<{ tempId, name, type }>
  changeSets: Array<ChangeSet>
  transactions: Array<ConfirmedTransaction>
}
```

**Response:**

```
CommitResult {
  entitiesCreated: number
  rulesApplied: { added, edited, disabled, removed }
  transactionsImported: number
  transactionsFailed: Array<{ checksum, error }>
  retroactiveReclassifications: number
}
```

## Business Rules

- The commit is atomic — if any part fails, nothing is written.
- Entity temp IDs must be resolved to real DB IDs before rules and transactions referencing them are written.
- Order of operations in commit: entities first, then rules, then transactions, then retroactive reclassification.
- Retroactive reclassification runs after rules are committed, within the same DB transaction.
- Reclassification is bounded — processes existing transactions in batches of 500.
- The user must explicitly click "Approve & Commit All" — no auto-commit.
- The "Back" button returns to Tag Review; user can go further back to make changes.

## Edge Cases

| Case                                                          | Behaviour                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No pending entities or rules (just transactions)              | Commit proceeds with transaction write only.                                            |
| Pending entity referenced by both a rule and a transaction    | Temp ID resolved once during entity creation, used by both rule and transaction writes. |
| Retroactive reclassification finds zero affected transactions | Commit succeeds, shows "0 existing transactions affected".                              |
| Commit fails partway                                          | Entire DB transaction rolls back, user sees error with detail, can retry.               |
| User navigates back from Final Review, makes changes, returns | Summary updates to reflect the new pending state from the stores.                       |
| Very large reclassification (10k+ transactions)               | Batched processing (500 rows per batch) with progress indication.                       |

## Out of Scope

- The local-first stores and merge layer (PRD-030)
- The global rule manager UI (PRD-032)
- Undo/rollback after commit is completed

# US-02: Movies search adapter (backend)

> PRD: [057 — Search Engine](README.md)
> Status: Partial

## Description

As the system, I search movies by title and return typed `SearchHit` results with poster URLs, year, rating, and runtime.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Adapter registered with `domain: "movies"`, icon: `"Film"`, color: `"purple"`
- [x] Searches movies by `title` column (case-insensitive LIKE)
- [x] Relevance scoring: exact match (1.0) > prefix (0.8) > contains (0.5)
- [x] `matchField: "title"` and `matchType` set correctly per hit
- [ ] Hit data shape: `{ title, year, posterUrl, voteAverage, runtime }` — `runtime` missing; adapter returns `genres` and `status` instead
- [x] Poster URL points to local cache (`/media/images/movie/{tmdbId}/poster.jpg`)
- [x] Respects `options.limit` parameter
- [x] Tests: search returns correct hits, scoring is correct, poster URLs resolved

## Notes

Searches the local library only — not TMDB. Only `title` is searched, not `original_title`.

# PRD-007: App Theme Colour Propagation

> Epic: [02 — Shell & App Switcher](../../epics/02-shell-app-switcher.md)
> Status: Done

## Overview

Build the mechanism that propagates an app's declared theme colour to all components within that app. When the user navigates to Media (indigo), every component that uses `bg-app-accent` automatically renders in indigo. When they switch to Finance (emerald), those same components render in emerald. No component knows which app it's in — the shell handles the propagation.

## How It Works

1. Each app declares a `color` in its `navConfig` (e.g., `color: "indigo"`)
2. The shell detects the active app from the current URL path
3. The shell sets `--app-accent` and `--app-accent-foreground` CSS variables on the app's container element
4. All nested components that use `bg-app-accent`, `text-app-accent`, etc. pick up the colour automatically via CSS cascade

### Colour Mapping

| App colour | `--app-accent` value                     | Usage            |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| emerald    | emerald-500 (light) / emerald-400 (dark) | Finance          |
| indigo     | indigo-500 / indigo-400                  | Media            |
| amber      | amber-500 / amber-400                    | Inventory        |
| rose       | rose-500 / rose-400                      | (future)         |
| sky        | sky-500 / sky-400                        | (future)         |
| violet     | violet-500 / violet-400                  | AI               |
| (none)     | primary                                  | Default fallback |

Each colour also needs a `--app-accent-foreground` for text-on-accent (typically white or near-white).

## Business Rules

- The shell is the only thing that sets `--app-accent` — app packages never set it directly
- Components in `@pops/ui` use `bg-app-accent` / `text-app-accent` — they don't know which colour they'll get
- The colour must propagate to all nested components without manual prop drilling
- Opacity modifiers must work (`bg-app-accent/10`, `text-app-accent/80`)
- App rail active indicator also uses the app's accent colour
- The colour updates instantly on app switch — no flash or delay

## Data Model

No database changes. The colour is declared in the app's `navConfig` (already part of the `AppNavConfig` type from PRD-006).

## Edge Cases

| Case                                                       | Behaviour                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| App has no `color` declared                                | Falls back to `--primary`                                                                                                          |
| Component used outside an app context (e.g., shell chrome) | Uses `--primary` fallback                                                                                                          |
| Transition between apps                                    | CSS variable update is instant — no animation needed on the variables themselves, but components may animate their own transitions |
| Storybook                                                  | Theme decorator (PRD-004 US-02) provides a colour picker to preview any app colour                                                 |

## User Stories

| #   | Story                                                 | Summary                                                                                    | Status | Parallelisable   |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ---------------- |
| 01  | [us-01-shell-propagation](us-01-shell-propagation.md) | Shell reads active app's colour from navConfig and sets CSS variables on the app container | Done   | No (first)       |
| 02  | [us-02-rail-accent](us-02-rail-accent.md)             | App rail active indicator uses the active app's accent colour                              | Done   | Blocked by us-01 |
| 03  | [us-03-verify-components](us-03-verify-components.md) | Verify all components using app-accent tokens render correctly across all app colours      | Done   | Blocked by us-01 |

## Verification

- Navigating to Finance shows emerald accents throughout
- Navigating to Media shows indigo accents throughout
- Navigating to Inventory shows amber accents throughout
- Components in `@pops/ui` never reference specific colour names (no `bg-indigo-600`)
- `grep` for hardcoded app colours in `@pops/ui` returns zero hits
- Opacity modifiers work (`bg-app-accent/10`)
- App with no declared colour falls back to primary
- Light and dark mode both work for all app colours

## Out of Scope

- The CSS variable definitions themselves (PRD-002 US-02)
- Replacing hardcoded colours in app packages (PRD-002 US-04)
- Per-page colour overrides within an app

## Dependencies

PRD-007 propagation is only effective when PRD-002 US-02 (define `--app-accent` CSS variable values) and PRD-002 US-04 (replace hardcoded colour classes with `bg-app-accent` tokens) are both complete. Without those, the shell sets variables that no component consumes.

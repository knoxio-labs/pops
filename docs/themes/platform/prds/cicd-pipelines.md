## Overview

GitHub Actions workflows for the pops repo. Quality gates run on every PR and on push to `main`; image publishing runs on push to `main` and `v*` tags (the images themselves are specified by the [Application Packaging & GHCR Contract](application-packaging.md) PRD). The repo is a federation of independent REST pillars under `pillars/*` plus shared libraries under `libs/*`; there is no `apps/` monolith, no `pops-api`, no `packages/*`. CI must therefore gate a **disk-discovered** set of units (TS pillars, TS libs, the Rust `contacts` pillar, and the seven `pillars/*/app` frontends) without a hand-maintained list, and collapse the resulting dynamic matrix down to **one statically-named required check** that the branch ruleset can require.

**No deployment workflow.** Server-side rollout is handled out-of-band by Watchtower on the deploy host pulling new GHCR digests (spec lives in `knoxio/homelab-infra` PRD-095). pops CI never SSHes to a server, never runs ansible, and never uses a self-hosted runner.

## The required-check problem and the CI Gate

The branch ruleset can only require checks by their **static context name**. Most of the load-bearing jobs (typecheck/test/build/clippy per unit) carry **dynamic matrix names** (`finance (pillar) — ts`, `@pops/app-food`, `contacts (pillar) — rust`, …) that change as units are added, so they cannot be listed in the ruleset individually. They live across six separate workflows, each with its own path filters, so a single `needs:`-chained umbrella workflow would either double-run every job or rename the existing required contexts.

`ci-gate.yml` solves this with a `workflow_run` aggregator. It **observes** the six gated workflows' conclusions at the same head SHA via the Actions API (zero extra CI cost, re-runs nothing) and reports a single `CI Gate` context. The ruleset requires that one context, which transitively makes every gated job load-bearing.

| Gated workflow (observed by CI Gate) | What it gates                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Quality`                            | Lint, format, module boundaries, duplication, scripts tests                                            |
| `Unit Quality`                       | Per-unit fmt/lint/build/typecheck/codegen-drift/test for every `pillars/*` + `libs/*` unit (TS + Rust) |
| `App Quality`                        | Each `pillars/*/app` frontend's own typecheck + test                                                   |
| `FE Quality`                         | Shell typecheck + test + build (compiles every app transitively)                                       |
| `Rust Quality`                       | Whole cargo workspace fmt/clippy/build/test + OpenAPI drift                                            |
| `Registry Generated Quality`         | `libs/module-registry` `generated.ts` drift                                                            |

Convergence rules baked into the gate:

- A failure is **sticky** — the failed run stays at the SHA, so any later re-evaluation (triggered by a slower sibling finishing) still sees it and reports red.
- A sibling still in flight is **not** a failure — the last sibling to complete re-triggers the gate and produces the authoritative verdict.
- A path-filtered-out sibling is **absent** from the API result and treated as non-failing (skipped ≠ failure), so docs-only PRs are not blocked.

## Workflows

### Required (named in the branch ruleset)

| Workflow / job                      | Trigger                                   | Steps                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| `quality.yml` → `Lint`              | PR (scoped) / push (full)                 | PR: `oxlint --type-aware` over `scripts` + the PR's changed unit dirs. Push to `main`: `pnpm lint` (whole tree)                                                                                                                                                             |
| `quality.yml` → `Format`            | PR (scoped) / push (full)                 | PR: `oxfmt --check` over `scripts` + the changed unit dirs. Push to `main`: `pnpm format:check` (whole tree)                                                                                                                                                                |
| `quality.yml` → `Module boundaries` | PR (scoped) / push (full)                 | PR: `depcruise` over `scripts` + the changed unit dirs (dependency-cruiser still follows the graph past those roots, so a changed unit reaching into another pillar is still caught). Push to `main`: `pnpm lint:boundaries` (`pillars libs scripts`)                       |
| `quality.yml` → `Duplication check` | PR / push (code paths)                    | `jscpd --threshold 5` over authored TS/TSX — deliberately whole-tree on every run: duplication is inherently cross-unit (e.g. code copy-pasted from an untouched pillar into the changed one), so scoping it to the changed dirs would blind it to that class of regression |
| `ci-gate.yml` → `CI Gate`           | `workflow_run` of the six gated workflows | Aggregate their conclusions at the head SHA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `agent-review.yml` → `agent-review` | Non-draft PR                              | Two blocking federation isolation guards + advisory LLM review                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

### Non-required additive gates (report, do not block)

These live inside the gated workflows but are explicitly **kept out** of the required-checks ruleset during the federation isolation phase. They surface regressions as signal without blocking merges; promote to required once the tree is clean.

- **Path filters on every workflow.** API changes don't trigger FE CI, and vice versa. Docs-only PRs (`docs/**`, `**/*.md`) are excluded from `quality.yml` entirely, keeping them to ≤ 4 required checks (the path-filtered siblings never run, so `CI Gate` never reports → non-blocking).
- **All workflows run on `ubuntu-latest`.** pops CI never depends on the home lab and never uses a self-hosted runner.
- **Discovery is from disk, never a hand-list.** Adding or removing a pillar, lib, or app needs no workflow edit. The unit display `name` (dir basename) is a path/display key ONLY — selectors always use the manifest `pkg` name (`@pops/pillar-sdk` for `libs/sdk`, `@pops/app-<id>` for apps), because `pnpm --filter` exits 0 on zero matches and would silently run nothing. Every TS lane asserts `--filter` matches exactly one package.
- **maxdepth-1 unit discovery is deliberate.** The `pillars/*/app` members live at maxdepth 2 and collide on basename `app`, so they are excluded from `unit-quality.yml` and covered by the App Quality (own tests) + FE Quality (shell build) lanes instead. `assert-app-coverage` turns that exclusion into a gate.
- **Shared-root touch invalidates everything.** A change to the lockfile, base/build tsconfig, formatter/linter config, mise root, or Cargo root rebuilds **all** units, not just the changed subset.
- **`quality.yml`'s Lint/Format/Module boundaries/Exports discipline scope to the PR's changed units.** They reuse `_discover-units.yml`'s changed matrix (same mechanism as `unit-quality.yml`) so an unrelated pillar's pre-existing violation cannot red out a sibling PR. `push` to `main` runs the original unscoped full-tree sweep as a drift safety net. Duplication stays whole-tree on every run — it is inherently a cross-unit metric.
- **Codegen and generated artefacts are drift-gated.** `generate:*` scripts, `module-registry/generated.ts`, the `contacts` OpenAPI spec, vendored contract snapshots, and the shell's nginx fallback conf must each match their committed form (`git diff --exit-code`).
- **Quality gates must pass before image publish.** Publish runs on the same push-to-main trigger; if a gated workflow fails on `main`, the deployer pins `POPS_IMAGE_TAG` rather than upgrading.
- **No deploy workflow in this repo** — Watchtower on the deploy host pulls new digests automatically.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Required gate

- [x] `quality.yml` runs lint (oxlint `--type-aware`), format check (oxfmt), module boundaries (dependency-cruiser), and duplication (jscpd) as four discrete required jobs
- [x] Lint, format, and module boundaries scope to `scripts` + the PR's changed unit dirs (via `_discover-units.yml`'s changed matrix); `push` to `main` keeps the original whole-tree sweep
- [x] `ci-gate.yml` aggregates the six gated workflows' conclusions at the head SHA via `workflow_run` and reports a single static `CI Gate` context that the ruleset requires
- [x] CI Gate treats path-filtered-out (absent) siblings as non-failing and only fails on an observed failure/cancelled/timed-out/startup-failure conclusion
- [x] CI Gate keeps the newest run per gated workflow at a SHA so a re-run supersedes an earlier attempt
- [x] `agent-review.yml` runs on every non-draft PR with two blocking isolation guards (`check-contract-isolation.mjs`, `check-lib-no-pillar-import.mjs`, each self-tested) plus an advisory LLM review that no-ops without `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

### Disk discovery

- [x] `_discover-units.yml` scans `pillars/*` + `libs/*` (maxdepth 1) and classifies each unit's lang from its manifest, emitting full + changed unit sets
- [x] A shared-root change (lockfile, base/build tsconfig, oxfmt/oxlint config, mise root, Cargo root) forces the changed set to all units
- [x] `assert-app-coverage` fails if any `pillars/*/app` member is not named `@pops/app-*` or not routed to both App Quality and FE Quality
- [x] Every TS lane asserts `pnpm --filter <pkg>` matches exactly one package and fails loud otherwise

### Per-unit quality

- [x] `unit-quality.yml` runs oxfmt-check, oxlint, dep-closure build, own-unit build (only when the unit owns a `build` task), typecheck, codegen drift, and test for every changed TS unit, and `fmt`/`clippy -D warnings`/build/test for every changed Rust unit
- [x] `app-quality.yml` runs each `@pops/app-*` frontend's own typecheck + test (preferring `test:coverage`) over a disk-discovered matrix
- [x] `fe-quality.yml` builds the shell SPA (compiling every app transitively), typechecks, tests, and gates the nginx fallback-conf for drift
- [x] `rust-quality.yml` runs the whole cargo workspace fmt/clippy/build/test and gates the `contacts` OpenAPI emission for drift
- [x] `registry-generated-quality.yml` regenerates `module-registry/src/generated.ts` and fails on diff

### Docker / schema / infra

- [x] `docker-build.yml` builds the builder stage of every `pillars/*/Dockerfile` (disk-discovered) and validates both compose files on PRs that touch them
- [x] `pillar-quality.yml` builds the full image of every pillar on push to `main`
- [x] `pillar-schema-coverage.yml` applies each pillar's migrations against a fresh DB and asserts table coverage, with a self-test that injects a fake table
- [x] `workflows-quality.yml` runs `yaml-lint` over `.github/workflows/*.yml` whenever any workflow changes
- [x] `infra-lint.yml` lints Litestream YAML on change

### Publishing / release / watchdog

- [x] `publish-images.yml` builds + pushes the full fleet to `ghcr.io/knoxio/pops-*` on every push to `main` and `v*` tags; pillar images are disk-discovered from the prod compose; a `workflow_dispatch only` input rebuilds a single image
- [x] `release.yml` (workflow_dispatch) computes semver, tags `vX.Y.Z`, and creates the GitHub Release
- [x] `format-drift-watchdog.yml` runs whole-tree `pnpm format:check` on `main` every 6h and opens/updates/closes a single tracking issue

### Cross-cutting rules

- [x] Path filters configured — workflows only trigger on relevant file changes; docs-only PRs are excluded from `quality.yml`
- [x] All workflows run on `ubuntu-latest` (no self-hosted runners)
- [x] A failing required workflow blocks PR merge via the `CI Gate` aggregator

## Out of Scope

- Auto-deployment to a server (Watchtower handles it; spec lives in homelab-infra PRD-095)
- The GHCR image contract, compose deployment artifact, secrets layout, and versioning (the [Application Packaging & GHCR Contract](application-packaging.md) PRD)
- Multiple deployment environments, blue/green, or canary
- Playwright e2e in CI — the suite was written against the deleted tRPC monolith and is `workflow_dispatch`-only pending a REST rewrite (see [docs/ideas/cicd-pipelines.md](../../../ideas/cicd-pipelines.md))

# POPS Documentation

## What is POPS?

POPS (Personal Operations System) is a self-hosted platform that manages finances, home inventory, media tracking, and more — from a single shell, one database, one API. It runs on a home server behind Cloudflare Tunnel with zero port forwarding.

See [vision.md](vision.md) for the full design philosophy.

## Reading Order

1. **[Vision](vision.md)** — Why POPS exists, design principles, strategy
2. **[Roadmap](roadmap.md)** — Phases, app priority, implementation tracker
3. **[Themes](themes/README.md)** — Strategic initiatives (Foundation, Media, Inventory, etc.)
4. **[Architecture](architecture/)** — ADRs for key technical decisions
5. **Theme epics and PRDs** — Detailed build specs per domain

| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Theme**      | Strategic domain overview, lists epics      | `themes/<name>/README.md`                   |
| **Epic**       | Scope and coordination for a chunk of work  | `themes/<name>/epics/NN-slug.md`            |
| **PRD**        | Detailed spec — data model, API, edge cases | `themes/<name>/prds/NNN-slug/README.md`     |
| **User Story** | Single implementable unit, bite-sized       | `themes/<name>/prds/NNN-slug/us-NN-slug.md` |

## Current State

POPS has a working platform with 4 apps (Finance, Media, Inventory, AI), deployed on a home server with Docker, Cloudflare Tunnel, and CI/CD. See the [roadmap implementation tracker](roadmap.md#implementation-tracker) for detailed status.

/**
 * API-side aggregator that joins the build-time `MODULES` install set
 * (from `@pops/module-registry`) with the live per-module `manifest` exports
 * in this app.
 *
 * The build-time registry intentionally only carries the serialisable
 * projection of each manifest (id, name, surfaces, …) — code-bearing slots
 * live alongside the module they belong to (PRD-101 US-02). Cross-cutting
 * concerns that need the live slots (settings, features, search, …) compose
 * the two halves at the call site through this module.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   import { installedManifests } from '../installed-modules.js';
 *
 *   const features = installedManifests().flatMap(
 *     (m) => m.features ?? []
 *   );

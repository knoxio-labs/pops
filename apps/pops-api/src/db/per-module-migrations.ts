/**
 * Per-module migration runner (PRD-101 US-09, #2543).
 *
 * Drizzle's flat journal lives in `drizzle-migrations/meta/_journal.json` —
 * before PRD-101 every entry in that journal ran unconditionally on boot
 * regardless of which modules were installed. After PRD-101 each module
 * declares the migration tags it owns via `manifest.backend.migrations`;
 * the runner reads `installedManifests()`, builds the union of allowed
 * tags, and skips entries owned by absent modules.
 *
 * Backward compatibility: the runner records applied migrations under the
 * same `__drizzle_migrations` hash convention `drizzle-orm/migrator` uses,
 * so a database upgraded from the pre-PRD-101 runtime continues to work
 * untouched — every entry already in `__drizzle_migrations` is treated as
 * applied and no re-application is attempted.
 *
 * Skipped (absent-module) migrations are NOT recorded — re-enabling the
 * module on a subsequent boot brings them in naturally.
 *
 * Orphan warning: if `__drizzle_migrations` contains hashes for tags
 * whose owning module is now absent, the runner logs a warning naming each
 * orphan tag so operators can spot leftover data from previously-installed
 * modules. Orphan migrations are NEVER deleted — data is intact.

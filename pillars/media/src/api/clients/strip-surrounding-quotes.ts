/**
 * Strip balanced surrounding double-quote characters from a media title.
 *
 * Use at upstream client mappers (TMDB / TheTVDB) so that titles returned
 * by the source API with surrounding quotes never reach the database in
 * that form.
 *
 * Rules:
 * - Must start AND end with `"` — one-sided quotes are preserved.
 * - All leading and all trailing `"` chars are removed (matches `TRIM`).
 * - If the trimmed result would be empty, the original is preserved
 *   (so `""` and `"""` are left alone rather than blanked).
 * - Internal quotes are preserved (e.g. `Film "Noir" Style` is untouched).

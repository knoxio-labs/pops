# Theme: Media

> Learn what I like, then tell me what to watch next.

## Strategic Objective

Build a personal media intelligence app — not just a tracker, but a system that learns preferences and surfaces recommendations. The core loop: watch something, rate it through quick 1v1 comparisons, the system refines its model of your taste, better suggestions appear. Output exceeds input.

## Success Criteria

- Adding a movie or show requires zero manual metadata entry — TMDB and TheTVDB provide everything
- Library and watch history are POPS-owned — Plex sync is one input source, not the only one
- 1v1 comparisons are fast (two taps) and enjoyable across multiple taste dimensions
- Recommendations use watch history, comparison data, and genre preferences — and improve over time
- "What should I watch tonight?" gives useful, personalised answers
- Recommendations flow into action — request content directly through Radarr/Sonarr from within POPS

## PRD Index

**Data Model & API**

The media domain schema (movies, TV hierarchy, comparisons, scores, watchlist, watch history) and the REST contract every other area builds on.

| #   | PRD                                              | Status |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| 028 | [Media Data Model & API](prds/data-model-api.md) | Done   |

**Metadata Integration**

External metadata clients — TMDB for movies, TheTVDB for TV — each handling search, metadata fetch, poster download/cache, and rate limiting.

**App Package & Core UI**

`@pops/app-media` — library browsing, external search with add-to-library, and detail views for movies and TV shows.

| #   | PRD                                                | Status  |

| 034 | [TV Show Detail Page](prds/tv-show-detail-page.md) | Partial |

**Tracking & Watchlist**

Watch history at episode level for TV, plus a prioritised watchlist that auto-removes on manual watches.

**Ratings & Comparisons**

Pairwise comparison across taste dimensions: pick a winner, ELO scores update, rankings and radar charts visualise the result.

| #   | PRD                                                                        | Status         |

**Discovery & Recommendations**

The recommendation engine and discover surface — trending, new releases, and personalised suggestions from comparison data, watch history, and genre preferences.

| #   | PRD                                                              | Status  |

**Plex Sync**

Polling-based sync with Plex: import library items, watch history, and watchlist. Plex is one input source — POPS owns the library.

**Radarr & Sonarr**

Radarr (movies) and Sonarr (TV) integration — status badges and full request management, replacing Overseerr as the single request interface inside POPS.

| #   | PRD                                                            | Status  |

| 042 | [Sonarr Request Management](prds/sonarr-request-management.md) | Partial |

**Library Rotation**

Automated movie lifecycle: source-fed candidates, a daily add/remove cycle gated on disk space, and a "leaving soon" grace period. Movies only.

## Key Decisions

| Decision              | Choice                       | Rationale                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Schema                | Split tables per media type  | TV hierarchy (show/season/episode) is fundamentally different from movies                       |
| Movie metadata        | TMDB                         | Industry standard, Radarr-aligned                                                               |
| TV metadata           | TheTVDB                      | Plex and Sonarr's native agent                                                                  |
| Rating system         | Pairwise ELO                 | More engaging than stars, richer taste profile                                                  |
| Comparison dimensions | User-configurable            | Stored as data, not code                                                                        |
| Pair selection        | Random (v1)                  | Simple. Smart selection is a future enhancement                                                 |
| Poster storage        | Local cache                  | ~1 GB for a large library, no external dependency at render time                                |
| Plex sync             | Polling                      | Simpler than webhooks, no network config                                                        |
| Radarr/Sonarr         | Status + request management  | Starts read-only, evolves to full request/management (replacing Overseerr)                      |
| Library ownership     | POPS-owned, multi-source     | Library and watch history live in POPS — Plex, manual add, and future sources feed into it      |
| Library rotation      | Automated daily cycle        | Source-fed candidates, weighted random selection, disk-space-gated, 10-day leaving grace period |
| Removal strategy      | Radarr delete + file removal | Space > bandwidth; re-downloading is the feature, not a cost                                    |

## Risks

- **External API dependency** — TMDB/TheTVDB rate limits or downtime. Mitigation: cache in SQLite, fetch once on add
- **Recommendation cold start** — Needs comparison data before suggesting. Mitigation: seed with community ratings, make comparisons engaging
- **Plex API instability** — Semi-official, changes without notice. Mitigation: isolate behind service boundary
- **Comparison fatigue** — If it feels like a chore, data never accumulates. Mitigation: 2 taps, contextual surfacing, never forced

## Out of Scope

- Music tracking
- Streaming service aggregation
- Social features (shared reviews, public profiles)
- Direct torrent/download management (Radarr/Sonarr handle that — POPS sends requests to them)
- Live TV, sports, news, games

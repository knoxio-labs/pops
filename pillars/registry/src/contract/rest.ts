/**
 * REST contract for the core pillar — ts-rest single source of truth.
 *
 * Composes the domain sub-routers into the public wire surface.
 * `generateOpenApi(coreContract, …)` projects this to
 * `openapi/registry.openapi.json`; `openapi-typescript` then projects the JSON
 * to `src/contract/api-types.generated.ts`.
 *
 * This is the pillar's single wire surface — every domain is served REST. The
 * registry's raw HTTP/SSE routes (discovery snapshot, register/heartbeat/
 * deregister, subscribe, `/pillars`, `/uri/resolve`) are mounted separately in
 * `api/app.ts`; they are not ts-rest shapes and do not appear here.

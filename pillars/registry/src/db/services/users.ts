/**
 * Read-only `users` surface for cross-pillar existence reconciliation.
 *
 * pops is a single-user system identified by an authenticated email
 * (Cloudflare Access or in-process dev fallback). There is no `users` table
 * — identity is the email itself, plus whatever rows happen to exist under
 * `user_settings.user_email`. That's enough to answer the only question a
 * sibling pillar's reconciliation cron asks: "does this user URI still
 * resolve?".
 *
 * The router accepts a URI (`pops://core/user/<email>`) as the cross-pillar
 * wire contract; this service is the email-shaped layer underneath. The
 * router parses the URI and forwards the extracted email here. A `null` here
 * is treated as 404 by the consumer — it stamps the consumer row's
 * `*_stale_at` rather than deleting it (existence is best-effort).
 *
 * No write surface is exposed: owning-pillar writes are forbidden, and the
 * dev-fallback email resolved by the identity middleware is mint-on-demand.

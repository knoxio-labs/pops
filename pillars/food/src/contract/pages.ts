/**
 * The pillar's page surface: one entry per route the app mounts, pairing the
 * route's path with the bundle slot that names the component rendering it.
 *
 * It lives in the contract because two packages need the same pairing and
 * neither can see the other's source. `src/api/manifest.ts` projects it onto
 * `ManifestPayload.pages` for the registry; `@pops/app-food` resolves the slot
 * to the component its route table already mounts.
 *
 * **Every route, not only the rail-reachable ones.** The shell mounts a
 * bundle-mapped pillar's whole `routes` array, but a pillar mounted through
 * the runtime loader gets exactly the pages listed here — so a route missing
 * from this list does not exist (POPS-3222). Most of food's routes are
 * detail and edit pages reached from a list rather than from the rail, which
 * is precisely why they are easy to leave out and hard to notice missing.
 *
 * The `data` tabs are `children` of the layout that renders their chrome,
 * mirroring `routes.tsx`. They were flattened here before POPS-3256, against
 * a comment saying the shell would "reconstruct the parent/child mounting" —
 * which nothing did, and which flattening cannot support anyway: the layout
 * would remount on every tab switch and lose its state. The slot names are
 * unchanged from that list, so this is a nesting change and not a rename.

 * Public extension factory for the DSL editor's issues surface.

 * feature needs — the `StateField` holding the diagnostic list, inline
 * decorations driven from that field, the hover-tooltip provider, the
 * diagnostic gutter, and the visual theme. Drop the result into the
 * editor's `extensions` array exactly once.
 *
 * The hook (`useDslEditorView`) drives state changes via
 * `setIssuesEffect`, exported from `issues-state` and re-exported here
 * for the hook's convenience.

/**
 * The pillar's UI surface: one page entry per route the app mounts, pairing
 * the route's path with the bundle slot that names the component rendering
 * it, plus the slot its capture overlay is served from.
 *
 * It lives in the contract because two packages need the same pairing and
 * neither can see the other's source. `src/api/manifest.ts` projects it onto
 * `ManifestPayload.pages` for the registry; `@pops/app-cerebrum` resolves the
 * slot to the component its route table already mounts.
 *
 * **Every route, not only the rail-reachable ones.** The shell mounts a
 * bundle-mapped pillar's whole `routes` array, but a pillar mounted through
 * the runtime loader gets exactly the pages listed here — so a route missing
 * from this list does not exist (POPS-3225). Six of the thirteen are detail
 * pages reached from a list rather than from the sidebar, which is precisely
 * why they are easy to leave out and hard to notice missing.

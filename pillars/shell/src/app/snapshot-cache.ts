/**
 * The last registry snapshot that resolved to a usable shell, kept so a
 * registry outage does not cost the operator every pillar's UI.
 *
 * The shell's offline floor used to be the static bundle map: whatever the
 * build had compiled in was what it mounted when `registry-api` was
 * unreachable. POPS-3215 empties that map one pillar at a time, and with it
 * that floor — at the end of the epic the shell would boot to its own chrome,
 * an empty rail and the settings page (POPS-3239).
 *
 * A registry outage is not a pillar outage. `registry-api` can be down or
 * mid-restart while `finance-api` and its UI bundle are both being served
 * perfectly well — the shell's own nginx serves `/finance-ui/` either way.
 * Losing every pillar's UI to a pillar-*discovery* problem is a worse trade
 * than showing the set that answered last time.
 *
 * So the cache holds the **wire snapshot**, not the resolved surface. The
 * snapshot is JSON the registry sent; the surface holds React components and
 * would not survive `JSON.stringify`. Re-resolving the cached snapshot through
 * the same walk gives bundle-mapped pillars their static entry and
 * loader-mounted ones their `assetsBaseUrl`, exactly as a live snapshot does.
 *
 * **No expiry, deliberately.** A stale entry advertises a pillar that may have
 * gone, and that failure is already contained: the loader wraps every remote
 * page in an error boundary, so a bundle that 404s degrades to a placeholder
 * on that pillar alone. An expiry has the opposite failure — a machine left
 * off for longer than the window boots to the empty shell this exists to
 * prevent. Every successful boot overwrites the entry, so the only way to hold
 * a stale one is to never boot successfully again.

/**
 * Fetch a loader-mounted pillar's bundle during boot instead of on first
 * navigation to it.
 *
 * A pillar the shell mounts through the runtime loader is a lazy `import()`
 * behind `<Suspense>`, so the request for its entry cannot be issued until the
 * shell has booted AND the reader has navigated to it. Measured on the
 * production build, that put the entry at 120ms and its page chunk at 140ms,
 * where a bundle-mapped pillar's code was already in the boot graph and done
 * at 49ms. The delay is not the bytes — the purchases entry is under a
 * kilobyte — it is that the round trip is serialised behind a decision the
 * reader has just made and is waiting on.
 *
 * The shell does not have to wait for that decision: the rail comes off the
 * wire, so every mounted pillar's `assetsBaseUrl` is known before first paint.
 * A `modulepreload` for each one moves the fetch into the boot window, in
 * parallel with the shell's own chunks, and leaves evaluation exactly where it
 * was — the module is still only evaluated when the route renders, so nothing
 * about the lazy-mount behaviour changes.
 *
 * What this does NOT collapse is the second hop. A page's chunk is reached by
 * a dynamic `import()` inside the remote bundle, so it is not part of the
 * entry's static graph and no preload the shell can emit from the manifest
 * covers it. Closing that would need the remote build to publish a
 * slot → chunk map, which is a wire-contract change and not this one.
 *
 * The cost is bounded and paid whether or not the pillar is visited: one small
 * entry per mounted loader pillar. That is the right trade while entries are
 * kilobyte-scale; if one ever is not, the fix is to make it a facade over its
 * own chunks rather than to stop preloading.

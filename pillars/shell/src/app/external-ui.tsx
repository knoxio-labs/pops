/**
 * Pillar UI loading (Option A).
 *
 * Every pillar reaches the shell through this module: one the build has never
 * heard of, registered at runtime, and one that lives in this repo, are the
 * same case. Both advertise an `assetsBaseUrl` on their manifest, and the
 * shell knows nothing else about either. POPS-3227 removed the static
 * `WORKSPACE_BUNDLE_MAP` that used to be the in-repo shortcut.
 *
 * The mechanism is Option A (not Module Federation): the shell `import()`s
 * the pillar's single ESM entry from the
 * URL it advertises and resolves each `PageDescriptor.bundleSlot` to a React
 * component the remote bundle exports. The nav rail comes off the wire
 * (`NavConfigDescriptor`) so it renders synchronously at boot; the remote
 * bundle is fetched lazily on first navigation, behind `React.lazy` +
 * `<Suspense>`, and wrapped in an `<ErrorBoundary>` so a failed load
 * (network error, missing slot, invalid bundle) degrades to a placeholder
 * instead of crashing the shell.
 *
 * This adds no bundler coupling: it is a runtime dynamic `import()` of a URL,
 * native to ES modules and Vite. What it costs is ADR-002's single static SPA,
 * which is the trade POPS-3215 made deliberately — the shell's own bundle no
 * longer carries any pillar's code, and a pillar can ship without it.
 *
 * ## The shared-runtime contract
 *
 * A remote bundle is a separate build, so anything it contains is a second
 * copy at runtime. For a package holding React context or module-global
 * state, a second copy is a correctness failure rather than a size one: two
 * React copies give two dispatchers and the pillar's first hook throws
 * `Invalid hook call`; two `@tanstack/react-query` copies give a component
 * reading an empty cache through a provider it cannot see; two `i18next`
 * copies give a pillar rendering raw keys. None of that fails at build time,
 * and each presents as a bug in the pillar rather than in the packaging.
 *
 * So: **the shell owns one instance of every specifier in
 * `SHARED_RUNTIME_SPECIFIERS` (`@pops/pillar-sdk/remote-build`), and a remote
 * bundle imports them rather than containing them.** The pillar build marks
 * them external — `pillars/purchases/app/vite.remote.config.ts` is the
 * reference, and its `scripts/build-remote.ts` fails the build if one slips
 * inside — and the shell resolves the resulting bare specifiers to its own
 * chunks through an import map it emits.
 *
 * Externalising without that import map is the point rather than a gap: the
 * browser refuses a bare specifier it cannot resolve, so a shell that has not
 * published its runtime fails the import loudly, into the `<ErrorBoundary>`
 * below, instead of a pillar quietly running on its own React. Emitting the
 * import map is the shell's half of this and lands with the first
 * loader-mounted in-repo pillar (POPS-3217).

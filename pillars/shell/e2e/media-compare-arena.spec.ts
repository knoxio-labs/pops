/**
 * E2E — Media compare arena: record one comparison pair
 *
 * Navigate to /media/compare, wait for a seeded pair to render,
 * pick a winner, confirm the outcome is recorded (session-count badge ticks
 * to 1), then visit /media/rankings and confirm both movies appear with a
 * score cell.
 *
 * Seed context:
 *   Smart-pair candidates are the intersection of watched movies and the
 *   non-watchlisted pool, which in the e2e seed reduces to five watched
 *   titles: Shawshank, Godfather, Dark Knight, Pulp Fiction, LOTR. The seed
 *   also inserts pre-computed scores across five dimensions, so the rankings
 *   page is non-empty from the moment the env is created.
 *
 * Idempotency:
 *   This flow is append-only — every run writes one row to the `comparisons`
 *   table in the e2e SQLite DB, and the picked movie's Elo score drifts up
 *   by roughly one K-factor step. The test does not rely on any exact score
 *   value; it only asserts that both movies render on the rankings page with
 *   a visible score cell, so accumulation across runs is tolerated. The
 *   session-count badge assertion (`"1"`) is safe because sessionCount is an
 *   in-memory React state reset on every page load.
 *
 * Crash detection is wired into beforeEach/afterEach so every test in this
 * suite verifies no uncaught JS error occurs.

/**
 * `POPS_APPS=finance,core` — what a restricted install set still gates.
 *
 * These run only against the `chromium-finance-only` project, whose shell is
 * built against a registry snapshot generated with that install set (see
 * `playwright.config.ts`). Two places still read the build-time set rather
 * than the live registry, and each is a different kind of leak if it breaks:
 *
 *   - `offlineInstallableSnapshot` narrows the CACHED snapshot through
 *     `isInstalledModule`, so an operator who excluded a module does not get
 *     it back the moment the registry goes quiet. Since POPS-3227 that cache
 *     is the whole of the offline floor — the in-repo bundle map it used to
 *     stand beside is gone — which makes it the only path the install set can
 *     still leak through, and the one the second test drives;
 *   - `isInstalledModule` in `libs/navigation` drops federated-search
 *     sections for modules this build did not ship, so results cannot link
 *     into a page that was never mounted.
 *
 * Two of these take the registry off the air deliberately. The boundary they
 * assert is the one the LIVE registry cannot restore: while it is answering it
 * IS the source of truth and `POPS_APPS` does not override it, so a snapshot
 * answering normally puts media on the rail on purpose.
 *
 * The exclusion tests therefore stub a registry that ANSWERS and omits media.
 * The first one used to fail the registry instead, and passed because a dead
 * registry mounted nothing and the router said "not installed" about
 * everything — asserting the defect POPS-3250 fixed rather than the gating it
 * was written for.

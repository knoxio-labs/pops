/**
 * `POPS_APPS=finance,core` — what a restricted install set still gates.
 *
 * These run only against the `chromium-finance-only` project, whose shell is
 * built against a registry snapshot generated with that install set (see
 * `playwright.config.ts`). Two places still read the build-time set rather
 * than the live registry, and each is a different kind of leak if it breaks:
 *
 *   - `staticFloorEntries` filters the in-repo bundle map through
 *     `isInstalledModule`, so an operator who excluded a module does not get
 *     it back the moment the registry goes quiet;
 *   - `isInstalledModule` in `libs/navigation` drops federated-search
 *     sections for modules this build did not ship, so results cannot link
 *     into a page that was never mounted.
 *
 * The registry is deliberately taken off the air in the first two tests. The
 * boundary they assert is the one the LIVE registry cannot restore, and a
 * snapshot answering normally would mount media through the bundle map and
 * hide it.

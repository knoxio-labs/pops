/**
 * Playwright configuration for POPS Shell E2E tests.
 *
 * No backend is booted. Every spec stands the pillar it exercises up at its
 * `/<pillar>-api` proxy path with `page.route`, so a run depends on the two
 * shell dev servers below and nothing else — no pillar process, no SQLite
 * file, no seeding step. What is under test is the shell and the app bundles
 * it mounts: that they ask the REST surface for the right thing and render
 * what came back.
 *
 * Install-set switching (`POPS_APPS` / `POPS_OVERLAYS`, resolved in
 * `libs/module-registry/src/install-set.ts`):
 *
 *   The shell consumes `MODULES` from `@pops/module-registry` at build
 *   time. To exercise the install-set boundary across two distinct shell
 *   builds in a single `pnpm test:e2e` run, this config defines two
 *   Playwright projects, each backed by its own `webServer`:
 *
 *     • `chromium-all-modules` (port 5567) — boots the shell against the
 *       canonical workspace registry (every known module installed).
 *     • `chromium-finance-only` (port 5569) — boots the shell against a
 *       pre-built registry snapshot generated with `POPS_APPS=finance,core`.
 *       The snapshot lives under `.e2e/registry/finance-only.js`; the
 *       Vite config picks it up via `POPS_REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT` and aliases
 *       `@pops/module-registry` to it for that server only.

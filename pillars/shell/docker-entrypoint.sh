# Production boot wiring for the pops-shell nginx image (Theme 13 PRD-255,
# US-02 boot-render + US-03 watcher). Runs before nginx so a pillar that
# self-registered with the core registry is routable on this boot, with no
# image rebuild.
#
# Flow:
#   1. Boot-render the conf from the LIVE registry. On ANY failure
#      (registry unreachable, render error, `nginx -t` rejects the output)
#      keep the committed static fallback at $SERVED_CONF — nginx ALWAYS
#      boots. The fallback is logged at warn level.
#   2. Start nginx (master), then the registry watcher, both as children.
#   3. Supervise: if EITHER exits, tear the other down and exit non-zero so
#      the orchestrator restarts the container (no silent half-dead state).
#
# Strict POSIX sh (alpine /bin/sh = busybox ash). No bashisms.

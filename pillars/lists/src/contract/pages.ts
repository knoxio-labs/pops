 * `ManifestPayload.pages` for the registry; `@pops/app-lists` resolves the
 * slot to the component its route table already mounts.
 *

 * bundle-mapped pillar's whole `routes` array, but a pillar mounted through
 * the runtime loader gets exactly the pages listed here — so a route missing
 * from this list does not exist (POPS-3224). `:id` is the detail page, which
 * is a deep link and has no sidebar entry to look broken if it went missing.

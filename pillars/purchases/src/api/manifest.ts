 * consumer takes it from here), and `icon`, which names the same Lucide
 * glyphs in the kebab-case the wire schema requires rather than the
 * PascalCase the app spells them in.

 * the rail. Purchases exists to reconcile against finance transactions and
 * the operator crosses between the two constantly, so the two belong
 * adjacent; the sparse scheme's gaps are what make placing a pillar at its

/**
 * Purchases pillar manifest payload.
 *
 * `nav` and `pages` were empty until this pillar had a frontend, because a
 * rail entry pointing at a bundle slot that does not exist is a dead link.
 * `pillars/purchases/app` is that slot, so both dimensions are declared now
 * — one nav item and one page descriptor per rail-reachable route the app
 * mounts (`pillars/purchases/app/src/routes.tsx`).
 *
 * `search.adapters` was never held back on that reasoning, though it used to
 * be justified by it. A search adapter is a backend seam — the orchestrator
 * POSTs `{ query, context }` to the pillar's own `/search` over the pillar SDK
 * and never touches a bundle — so the only thing declaring one requires is
 * that the route exists. It does (`src/contract/rest-search.ts`).
 *
 * `routes.queries` carries that one path because the manifest validator
 * refuses a search adapter whose `procedurePath` no declared route backs
 * (`checkSearchAdapterProceduresAreDeclared`). It is not an inventory of the
 * pillar's routes and does not claim to be one.
 *
 * `ai.tools` stays empty, and that is a different decision from the one
 * above rather than the same one twice: this slot is the pillar hosting tool
 * *definitions* for the orchestrator's AI tool-router to project. The
 * pillar's assistant reach is served instead by MCP tool modules in
 * `pillars/mcp/src/tools/purchases.ts`, which call these routes over the SDK
 * — the same arrangement finance, inventory, media and cerebrum have, none
 * of which declare `ai.tools` either.
 *
 * `uri.types` names both types the search adapters emit. It was empty while
 * nothing could resolve them; `pillars/purchases/app` now mounts an order
 * detail route and `libs/navigation`'s `URI_ROUTE_MAP` carries both prefixes,
 * so the claim is backed. A line resolves to the order it was bought on —
 * ADR-012 keeps the id segment one row's primary key, so the order id travels
 * in the hit's `data` rather than in the URI — and the pillar still emits the
 * line's own identity, because a hit that named its order would be
 * indistinguishable from the order's own hit.

/**
 * The pillar's page surface: one entry per route the app mounts, pairing the
 * route's path with the bundle slot that names the component rendering it.
 *
 * It lives in the contract because two packages need the same pairing and
 * neither can see the other's source. `src/api/manifest.ts` projects it
 * onto `ManifestPayload.pages` for the registry; `@pops/app-ai` resolves the
 * slot to the component its route table already mounts.
 *
 * **Every route, not only the rail-reachable ones.** The shell mounts a
 * bundle-mapped pillar's whole `routes` array, but a pillar mounted through
 * the runtime loader gets exactly the pages listed here — so a route missing
 * from this list does not exist (POPS-3220). Three of ai's four routes render
 * nothing but a redirect into finance or the settings page, and they are on
 * this list for that reason: leaving them off would turn a working link into
 * a 404 rather than into a page the reader can see is absent.

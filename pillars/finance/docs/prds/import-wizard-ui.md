# Import Wizard UI

Status: Partial — the full 8-step wizard ships and works end to end. Missing:
the `isNew` "New" marker on AI-suggested tags and per-tag accept/reject in Tag
Review (the wire carries `isNew` but the UI never renders or acts on it). Those
live in `docs/ideas/import-tag-accept-reject-and-new-markers.md`.

An 8-step wizard that ingests bank-statement CSVs into the transaction ledger:
upload → map columns → server processing → review entities → tag review →
rule creation → final review/commit → summary. Every unresolved item is
surfaced and fixed before anything touches SQLite. All entity creations, rule
ChangeSets, tag-rule ChangeSets, and tag edits are buffered in the local
Zustand store during steps 1–6; the **only** database write is `commitImport`
on step 7 (final review).

There is no online/in-person attribute anywhere in this flow — "online vs
in-person" is a normal tag applied via `transaction_tag_rules`, not a field.

## Data model (client state — Zustand `importStore`)

- `currentStep: 1..8`, sequential navigation (`nextStep`/`prevStep`/`goToStep`/`reset`).
- Step 1: `file: File | null`, `bankType: 'ANZ' | 'Amex' | 'ING' | 'Up'`.
- Step 2: `headers`, `rows`, `columnMap { date, description, amount, location? }`,
  `parsedTransactions: ParsedTransaction[]` plus a content fingerprint.
- Step 3: `processSessionId`, `processedTransactions { matched, uncertain, failed, skipped, warnings? }`,
  `processedForFingerprint`.
- Buffered (steps 4–6, never written until commit): `pendingEntities[]`,
  `pendingChangeSets[]` (correction rules), `pendingTagRuleChangeSets[]`,
  `confirmedTransactions[]`.
- Step 7/8: `commitResult: CommitResult | null`.
- Changing the file or re-parsing to a different fingerprint cascades a
  `downstreamReset` so stale processed/confirmed/pending state can never leak
  into a new run.

`ParsedTransaction` = `{ date (YYYY-MM-DD), description, amount, account (the
selected bankType), location?, rawRow (JSON of the source row), checksum (SHA-256
of the canonical dedup key — date + amount + normalized description + bank
reference — see import-dedup-csv) }`.

## REST API surface (finance pillar, `imports.*` contract)

- `POST /imports/process` → `{ sessionId }` — start dedup + entity/type
  classification + AI fallback in the background.
- `GET /imports/progress?sessionId` → `ImportProgress | null` — poll; `null`
  means unknown/expired session.
- `POST /imports/entities` → created entity — on-the-fly entity creation during a session.
- `POST /imports/apply-changeset-reevaluate` → applies a correction ChangeSet
  atomically, then re-evaluates the session (Save & Learn approve path; 412 on conflict).
- `POST /imports/reevaluate-pending` → re-evaluate the session against merged
  (DB + pending) rules, no DB writes.
- `POST /imports/commit` → `CommitResult` — the single write path: create
  entities, apply ChangeSets + tag-rule ChangeSets, write transactions, run
  retroactive reclassification, atomically.
- `POST /imports/execute` exists in the contract but is not part of the wizard
  flow (the wizard commits via `/imports/commit`).

Entity list for the dropdowns comes from the entities/contacts read endpoints,
fetched once and cached for the review step.

## Steps & acceptance criteria

### 1. Upload

- [x] Bank radio picker (ANZ / Amex / ING / Up); help card shows bank-specific export instructions for the selection.
- [x] CSV file input, max 25 MB; parsed client-side with PapaParse (`header: true`, skip empty lines).
- [x] Validates file present, CSV non-empty, headers present; invalid files show an error and block advance.
- [x] On success stores `headers`/`rows` and advances. Bank selection drives the help copy and sets each parsed transaction's `account` (`bankType`, threaded into validation and the `/imports/process` body — #3608).

### 2. Column mapping

- [x] Auto-detects date / description / amount / location from header names; user can override each via a per-field dropdown of all headers.
- [x] Required: date, description, amount. Optional: location. Cannot advance until all required are mapped; unmapped required fields are flagged.
- [x] Preview table of the first 10 rows with mapped values.
- [x] Client-side row parsing: date `DD/MM/YYYY` → `YYYY-MM-DD`; amount strip currency, parse, invert sign (bank charges positive → expenses negative); location first line, title-cased; `rawRow` preserved as JSON; checksum = SHA-256 of the canonical dedup key (date + amount + normalized description + bank reference — #3611), not the raw row.
- [x] Invalid rows excluded; first 10 validation errors shown.
- [x] Output `ParsedTransaction[]` stored in the store.

### 3. Processing

- [x] Calls `POST /imports/process`, stores the returned `sessionId`; network failure surfaces a retry.
- [x] Polls `GET /imports/progress` every 1 s; shows current phase (deduplicating / matching), processed/total, and a live batch preview of recent items with status.
- [x] Stops polling on `completed`, stores `{ matched, uncertain, failed, skipped, warnings }`, advances.
- [x] If AI categorisation was unavailable, a warning banner is shown and those transactions route to uncertain (not failed). Sessions self-expire (~5 min); a gone session surfaces as expired.

### 4. Review entities

- [x] Tabs Matched / Uncertain / Failed / Skipped, each with a count badge; Skipped is read-only with a "Duplicate (checksum match)" reason.
- [x] Transaction card shows description, colour-coded amount, date, account; matched cards show entity + match-type badge; uncertain show AI suggestion + confidence; failed show the error.
- [x] Uncertain/Failed: searchable entity dropdown (from the entity list), an "Accept" shortcut for an AI suggestion, and a "Create Entity" dialog (name only, defaults to company type; conflict surfaces the existing match). Selecting/creating an entity moves the transaction to Matched.
- [x] Assigning an entity detects similar still-unresolved transactions (number-agnostic, case-insensitive cleaned-description match) and offers to apply the assignment to them.
- [x] Edit dialog: description, amount, account, entity, location, transaction type. Edits are local only.
- [x] Type override to `transfer` or `income` makes entity optional and lets the transaction reach Matched without one. (Type-only corrections classify with no entity and are terminal — see `corrections`.)
- [x] Gate: "Continue to Tag Review" is disabled while any uncertain/failed remain and shows the remaining-count reason; enables once all are resolved.
- [x] Rule-matched transactions are badged as such, with pattern / match type / confidence in the badge tooltip and an "+N overridden" popover for lower-priority rules that also matched.
- [x] **Save & Learn**: editing or assigning opens a bundled **Correction Proposal** (see `correction-proposal-engine`) — proposed rule ops with pattern/match-type/confidence/rationale and an in-import impact preview. Approve applies the ChangeSet atomically (`/imports/apply-changeset-reevaluate`) and re-evaluates remaining transactions; Reject requires a feedback message and can generate a follow-up proposal. Rules are never changed without explicit approval.
- [x] Triggering Save & Learn (accept / create / edit) opens the Correction Proposal **immediately in a loading state** before the analysis round-trip resolves; while it generates, accept/create is blocked and the loading dialog can't be dismissed, so a second action can't clobber the window about to open.
- [x] Editing a rule-matched transaction does **not** silently override the match — it opens a Correction Proposal ChangeSet (add / edit / disable / remove rules) with the same approve/reject-and-reevaluate flow.
- [x] "Manage Rules" opens the rule manager (browse mode) for full CRUD over DB + pending rules.

### 5. Tag review

- [x] Transactions grouped by entity name into collapsible sections (expanded by default) with per-group counts; transactions without an entity fall into a "No Entity" group.
- [x] Per-transaction inline `TagEditor` pre-populated with the processing step's suggested tags; autocomplete from server tags + tags typed this session; free-form entry; remove via chip ✕. Edits stored per transaction by checksum.
- [x] Suggested-tag source badges: 🤖 AI, 📋 Rule (tooltip shows the matched pattern), 🏪 Entity (entity default tags).
- [x] Group-level bulk apply and per-group "Apply Suggestions" use **merge** semantics — added to existing tags, deduplicated, never replacing individual edits. "Accept All Suggestions" available.
- [x] "Save rule…" per row offers tag-rule learning via the proposal + approval + reject-with-feedback model, scoped to tag rules (see `tag-rule-proposals`).
- [x] Advancing persists per-transaction tag edits to the session and goes to step 6 — no `/imports/commit` and no DB write here.

### 6. Create rules

- [x] Groups confirmed transactions by entity; for any group where ≥50% share the same tags, proposes a `contains` rule shown as a toggleable card (entity, pattern, tag chips, affected count), all checked by default.
- [x] "Skip" advances with no changes; "Create N rules →" pushes the selected proposals into `pendingTagRuleChangeSets` and advances. Empty state when no patterns are detected.

### 7. Final review & commit

- [x] Read-only summary of everything pending: new entities, correction ChangeSets (grouped, add/edit/disable/remove), tag-rule ChangeSets, transaction breakdown, tag-assignment count; empty state when nothing is pending.
- [x] "Approve & Commit All" calls `POST /imports/commit` (the single atomic write: entities, rules, tag rules, transactions, retroactive reclassification), with a committing indicator; on success stores `CommitResult` and advances. "Back" returns to earlier steps for edits.

### 8. Summary

- [x] Cards for entities created, rules applied (with add/edit/disable/remove breakdown incl. tag rules), transactions imported, and transactions failed; failed list is expandable with per-row checksum + error; retroactive reclassification count shown.
- [x] "New Import" resets the wizard; "View Transactions" navigates to the transactions list.

## Business rules

- Steps are sequential — you can go back but not skip ahead.
- Step 4 gates: all uncertain/failed must be resolved (assigned, or type-overridden to transfer/income) before step 5.
- Transfer/income type override makes entity optional.
- Tag bulk apply is additive (merge), never destructive of individual edits.
- Nothing is written to SQLite until `/imports/commit` on step 7; all of steps 4–6 mutate only local store state and approved-but-deferred ChangeSets.
- Backend progress entries auto-clean after ~5 minutes.

| All transactions duplicates            | Only the Skipped tab is populated; nothing to review                 |
| AI unavailable (no key / rate-limited) | Warning banner; affected transactions route to uncertain, not failed |
| Create an entity that already exists   | Conflict surfaced; the existing match is suggested                   |
| Browser closed mid-processing          | Session expires (~5 min); re-import required                         |

# Theme: Finance

> Budgeting, transaction tracking, bank imports, AI-powered categorisation — fully automated personal finance.

## Strategic Objective

Build a finance app that tracks every transaction across multiple bank accounts, automatically categorises them, matches them to merchants, and surfaces spending insights. Bank CSVs go in, tagged and categorised transactions come out. Manual input is the exception, not the rule.

## Success Criteria

- Bank CSVs import through a generic column-mapping flow with automatic entity matching and checksum-based deduplication; per-bank parsers (ANZ/Amex/ING sign + column logic, ANZ PDF) and Up Bank API batch/webhook persistence are not yet built — see `docs/ideas/per-bank-parsers.md` and `docs/ideas/up-bank-api-import.md`
- Transactions categorised by learned rules and AI fallback — manual tagging decreases over time
- Budget tracking shows spending against monthly/yearly targets by category
- Wishlist tracks savings goals with progress
- Import pipeline handles edge cases (duplicates, partial imports, unknown merchants) gracefully

## PRD Index

**Transactions**

The transaction ledger — the core data model and UI for viewing, creating, editing, and deleting financial transactions across multiple bank accounts, with filtering, sorting, and inline tag editing.

| PRD                                  | Summary                                                                               | Status |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| [Transactions](prds/transactions.md) | Transaction data model, ledger page with CRUD, filtering, sorting, inline tag editing | Done   |

**Import Pipeline**

The multi-step import wizard that ingests bank data into the ledger — wizard UI, the entity-matching engine (deterministic ladder + env-gated AI fallback), deduplication, per-bank CSV parsers, and a local-first buffer that commits atomically.

| PRD                                                          | Summary                                                                                                                                          | Status  |

**Entities**

The merchant/payee registry that transactions match against is owned by the `contacts` pillar; finance consumes it read-only via `pillar('contacts').entities.list` and keeps no entities table of its own.

| PRD                                                                   | Summary                                                       |

| [`contacts/docs/prds/entities`](../../contacts/docs/prds/entities.md) | Entity data model, CRUD, search, aliases, default tags, types |

**Corrections**

Learned classification rules and separate tag rules that improve over time — pattern matching (exact / contains / regex) with confidence scoring, bundled ChangeSet proposals with impact preview, and explicit priority ordering.

| PRD                                                                      | Summary                                                                                                                                         | Status      |

**Budgets**

Budget tracking — spending categories with monthly, yearly, or one-time limits, showing actual spend against target with an active/inactive toggle per budget.

| PRD                        | Summary                                                                                              | Status |

| [Budgets](prds/budgets.md) | Budget data model, CRUD page, period types (monthly/yearly), spend vs target, active/inactive toggle | Done   |

**Wishlist**

Savings goals — items the user wants to buy, each with a target price and tracked progress toward that goal.

| PRD                          | Summary                                                                       | Status |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| [Wishlist](prds/wishlist.md) | Wishlist data model, CRUD page, target amounts, progress tracking, priorities | Done   |

**AI Rule Creation**

AI-powered live rule creation during import — when a user corrects a transaction's entity, Claude derives a matching rule that applies immediately to remaining rows, so manual corrections trend toward zero.

| PRD                                          | Summary                                                                                             | Status  |

## Key Decisions

| Decision        | Choice                                                                     | Rationale                                                                           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Entity matching | Corrections > aliases > exact > prefix > contains > AI fallback            | Layered strategy, ~95-100% hit rate before AI                                       |
| AI provider     | Claude Haiku                                                               | Cheap, good enough for categorisation                                               |
| AI caching      | None — every uncached-entity import calls the API                          | Simplicity over cost; a disk/DB cache was considered and dropped, see `docs/ideas/` |
| Deduplication   | SHA-256 checksum of a canonical date+amount+description+bank-reference key | Handles duplicate CSVs without unique transaction IDs                               |
| Import format   | One generic column-mapping flow; per-bank parsers not yet built            | Each bank has different CSV formats                                                 |

## Risks

- **Bank format changes** — Banks change CSV exports without notice; the generic column-mapping flow requires the user to remap by hand
- **AI cost creep** — New merchants trigger uncached API calls every import. Mitigation: learned corrections reduce AI dependency over time
- **Dedup false positives** — Same amount, same day, different merchants. Mitigation: entity matching narrows the window

## Out of Scope

- Real-time bank feeds (Up Bank webhook exists but only logs events; no persistence)
- Multi-currency support
- Investment or stock tracking
- Tax filing or reporting
- Shared/joint account management
